4,"I will be suing Robinhood for $295,000 if they do not allow me to exercise my FRC puts",Discussion,"One week ago, I reached out of Robinhood to inquire if I could cash out (exercise) my puts if FRC is suspended.

[Exhibit 1](https://preview.redd.it/ga1oydmq08xa1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=61616e1245248e7787ed1fbdceba453cf9114467)

I was assured in writing that I would be able to exercise my in the money puts into a short position in the scenario that FRC is suspended.

[Exhibit 2](https://preview.redd.it/r43fzx5q18xa1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=43b242122002201f188a57f9097f943f0aaca97b)

I bought and held puts which are now worth $295,000 based on these written assurances from this Robinhood representative.

[Current position, if exercised would be worth $295,000](https://preview.redd.it/fvgtm99728xa1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8917b0c6e1f3b71d9d8651284b3b098da259dca1)

I reached out to support recently to confirm what they already told me; that I would be able to exercise my options by entering a short position. They responded saying I ""may"" be able to exercise, but as of now they do not allow short sales

I've already consulted a lawyer. Based on these written guarantees, I am likely to win if this comes down to a lawsuit. Robinhood, which claims to represent retail investors, has yet again proven to have no regard for their customers. While I am fully willing to go the legal route, I urge my fellow WSBers to put pressure on Robinhood to do the right thing. My correct bet, could potentially expire worthless as a result of Robinhood's lying, backstabbing practices. 

We did not allow Robinhood to get away with disabling the buy button. Yet time and time again they‚Äôve shown they have no problem mistreating their users and causing large financial losses. The only time they act is when there is a large enough public backlash. Let‚Äôs hold Robinhood accountable. This is not just for me, it‚Äôs for the thousands who made the correct bet on FRC and may have their gains held hostage by Robinhood.",2023-05-01 13:41:29,24181,"Dude.

The complicated bit is that management consultants (that usually are the ones making or breaking the careers of professional managers in medium and big companies) now have a new tool to sell. This leads the management (CEOs and those that can influence them) to want to do that kind of projects, so that management consultants can bill some more stuff that actually doesn‚Äôt bring any value to the company, and as a token of gratitude push the career of their corporate counterparts.

7,"Robinhood will let my $295,000 in FRC puts expire worthless, while other brokers allow users to cash out",Discussion,"The OCC has released guidance allowing FRC put holders to cash out and exercise their puts. Multiple brokerages like IBKR and Fidelity are allowing put holders without shares to exercise into a short position if they have enough cash collateral. 

Robinhood is also allowing FRC put holders to exercise. However due to their policy against short selling, most put holders are unable to exercise and cash out. 

[Robinhood playing chicken with my life savings](https://preview.redd.it/smm8z10dcfxa1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d712a9972de990965c848a25c83bbb854e985726)

I falsely assumed Robinhood had its users best interests at heart. In fact I was so confident, that I arrogantly claimed Robinhood would allow me to exercise. Robinhood had previously [allowed SBNY put holders to exercise](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandonkochkodin/2023/03/16/robinhood-bends-to-pressure-and-permits-short-selling-to-replace-put-options-on-signature-bank/?sh=4e14256b2312). I foolishly used this amongst other misinformation to misconstrue that Robinhood cared about its customers. I am deeply sorry to everyone I lashed out on defending such a corrupt, vile, dishonorable company.  

Yes I have a huge stake in making this post: [my life savings](https://preview.redd.it/kc5krwnoefxa1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9885568c0629bfe6dca04f397d3754361b1ccfc6)

I greedily ignored the advice of WSB and held my winning position until FRC was halted. I was overwhelmingly warned not to count on Robinhood to do right by its customers. I am extremely regretful for not listening. I know I'm not the right person to be championing this. I acted like a cocky asshole to everyone because I was so sure of myself. I was wrong and I am sorry. 

However, this is bigger than my dumb degenerate gambling ass. This is an injustice. Robinhood has every ability to cash out FRC put holders. Yet they will allow people who correctly bet against First Republic to lose everything. Thousands of dollars in Robinhood customer‚Äôs FRC puts will expire worthless on Friday. We cannot let Robinhood get away with ripping its customers off for thousands of dollars. This billion dollar company treats it's users like worthless pond scum. FUCK ROBINHOOD. 

I urge everyone reading this to reach out to Robinhood via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/robinhoodapp?s=21&t=ZU51B0sCBCIMwSP-8sbfgQ) and other social media platforms. If Robinhood bends to the pressure and allows short selling on FRC for put holders, I will donate $10,000 of my gains to the [Autism Society of America](https://autismsociety.org). Under threat of ban, I make this donation pledge. 

Footnote: Yes, I will attempt to sue Robinhood if they do not allow me to exercise. This is my last ditch effort to exhaust all routes before taking that leap.

Update: FRC will resume trading on OTC tomorrow. I should be able to sell my puts for a large gain. However Robinhood has a policy against OTC trading too. Thus they still may not let me cash out. The battle may continue‚Ä¶.

Update update: RH support confirmed that I ‚Äúshould‚Äù be able to sell my puts tomorrow. Not for certain, but looks very likely I can cash out tomorrow.",2023-05-02 14:37:08,21551,People like OP are so fucking annoying

11,"I will be suing Wendy‚Äôs for $295,000 if they do not allow me to order breakfast",Shitpost,"Sorry I don‚Äôt have screenshots as this was over the phone and then later in person. 

I called Wendy‚Äôs around 10:15 AM and asked if they were serving breakfast. The employee specifically told me that they were.  I asked a second time and they confirmed. 

I wanted to be absolutely sure so I asked, and I remember word-for-word, I said ‚Äúso if I come into your restaurant, I will be able to order and receive breakfast, is that right?‚Äù

The employee responded, and I quote, ‚Äúyou will be able to order breakfast if you get here before lunch starts. If you get here any later, you‚Äôll have a hard time getting breakfast.‚Äù

Perfect!

So, I wanted to wait until I was as hungry as humanly possible, to maximize my meal, so I went in to Wendy‚Äôs at about 2 o‚Äôclock that afternoon and I was SHOCKED when they wouldn‚Äôt let me order breakfast. 

Please, everyone, if we all reach out to Wendy‚Äôs on social media and apply enough pressure, they will be forced to correct this miscarriage of justice.

I‚Äôll be pleasantly surprised if he does, but given how anal he is about wording, I have no faith this was not his intention.

108,I am never trading options again,Discussion,"This was the original title and post I wrote up before the events of Thursday transpired. Everything in quotes was written by past me: 

""I‚Äôve disabled options trading. I will dump all my money into blue chips and index funds. I‚Äôve just made 100k over a span of 3 days. 

[The contracts gained more value, but I didn't screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/m6328lnwazxa1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=941ae246e2343e27309b900995013d786979eb42)

https://preview.redd.it/ku4wnnqxazxa1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=223b799b39914587b4d0249eb068e76e7d92f942

The screen shots are incomplete because I was trying to sell quick. It‚Äôs about 100k profit when you factor in I lost 60k entering the trade on shorter dated puts. 

I‚Äôm going to be completely candid. Whether that gets me banned or not, I will take that risk. 

From the moment I uttered this comment, I set fourth the most regarded scheme in history. 

[When I decided to hold until recivership ](https://preview.redd.it/hgp4xiumdzxa1.png?width=766&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=93ad40470e4aabb9e4498360229c49049ebadc61)

At the time, FRC hadn‚Äôt halted trading. I reached out to Robinhood support to get their stance on what would happen during a halt. I didn‚Äôt show the full conversation, but they were extremely unclear. They said that I would be short if I exercised, but I‚Äôd have a hard time covering that short position. Although this is not saying yes or no, it‚Äôs definitely terrible communication on their part. 

A lawsuit based on the hypothetical scenario we discussed is a complete long shot. Out of curiosity, I asked a lawyer that day. They said I was likely to win if Robinhood backed out but they needed more details. I did not trust this scummy lawyer. I had another option. [Robinhood had previously cracked to social media pressure and allowed people to exercise puts into a short position.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brandonkochkodin/2023/03/16/robinhood-bends-to-pressure-and-permits-short-selling-to-replace-put-options-on-signature-bank/?sh=6a7e783c2312) They have a history of bending to social media backlash. There‚Äôs even this disclaimer when stocks are halted: 

[This is directly from backlash on Reddit when they disabled the buy button. ](https://preview.redd.it/hmv5lc8jbzxa1.jpg?width=1152&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=79c40f3d5f226d9ec357240c97d7c3c671973089)

I thought I could increase the odds by creating viral posts about Robinhood‚Äôs misdeeds. Hopefully Robinhood would crack knowing their name was being smeared on the front page of Reddit. WSB backing me would have been helpful but not necessary. I just needed to make noise. 

I believed the chances I could cash out were high to begin with. I was sort‚Äôve right. Multiple brokers allowed exercising into a short. Just not Robinhood. They still may have made an exception, as their support told me multiple times it ‚Äúmight‚Äù happen. But I wasn‚Äôt about to wait till expiration without a fight. 

Within the quest to fight Robinhood, I made this bet: 

[The fateful ban bet](https://preview.redd.it/a7vosyp6azxa1.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=24ed87d78254c2e0df849fd6f5f5fb4f61394af4)

Robinhood did not allow short selling for FRC put holders as the terms of the bet demanded. I sold the contracts instead of exercising. \[Based on the terms of the bet I do not have to pay anything. I still planned on donating a few thousand until yesterday.\]

Whether this scheme would have worked, I guess we‚Äôll never know. FRC began trading OTC and exercising was not necessary anymore. 

Despite being correct, I‚Äôve taken up a reckless unsustainable trading approach. If I continue on this path, I will lose everything. I‚Äôve seen it so many times where someone makes a very intelligent correct trade, then starts thinking they‚Äôre a trading genius. They start making reckless bets in things they have no business buying. This is an extremely slippery slope for me. I‚Äôve blown up multiple accounts and I refuse to make the same mistake. I hope I can set an example- don‚Äôt keep rolling the dice. Take the money and run. 

I know it‚Äôs very obvious to everyone; cashing out is the smart thing to do. But in my position the rush of euphoria from a massive win like this is intoxicating. The sobering despair of previous losses melts away. It‚Äôs very hard to fight the imaginative ideas of becoming a multimillionaire and retiring under 30. I hope I can set an example and inspire others to break the gambling cycle. Hopefully, I will be able to maintain self control, but the urge to make one more bet is always there. I refuse let myself squander this life altering amount of money.""

**PRESENT MOMENT:**

I saw PACW tanking after hours based on news that they were looking for sellers. They had already said this in their ER that they were looking to sell assets. I felt the drop overblown fear from FRCs collapse. 

I bought when it was at $2.90 but because I didn‚Äôt put a limit order in RH averaged purchase price was fucking $3.40 my god. Immediate 40k loss.

[Paper handed while it was dumping after Robinhood's shitty payment for order flow bought the shares at an inflated price. ALWAYS SET LIMIT ORDERS](https://preview.redd.it/4oshkmswbzxa1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fa9c33e89c5427e507e7bc4e698a9b8136762e54)

 Then I think to myself: PACW‚Äôs drop is not completely overblown. The need to shore up liquidity is bad in this environment and a recovery is higher risk. So I thought, let me buy a regional that is being pulled down just because everything is tanking: FHN. 

The TD CEO firmly stated they were committed to buying FHN. So any massive drop has huge upside. Surely TD wouldn‚Äôt back out of the deal 8 hours after I go all in. 

[I sold around 9.70, still lost a ton, but this loss wasn't fully realized](https://preview.redd.it/uu66q2n6czxa1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=28373d7f334343804e2d2da620c31aef94aec21e)

I am completely spiraling into whirlpool of gambling and degeneracy. I am trying to control myself. I lost another 50k yesterday and made it back just as quick. I'm playing with fire and I'm foolishly dead set on making back what I've lost. I've finally found an amazing risk reward trade to make all my money back plus profit. Selling WAL puts. I still stand by the idea that this current panic in regionals is far overblown. WAL especially is nothing like FRC and its odds of collapse are extraordinarily low. Currently selling $12 puts for a huge premium while that stock is at $20, this is a very safe bet to make back everything. I will roll into the $2.5 puts for an even safe bet. IV is at 500%, this is almost free money. WAL is not like FRC, even if PACW falls, WAL will be ok. 

[Everything is riding on WAL surviving. Very safe bet in my opinion.](https://preview.redd.it/5z83n0mzczxa1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=710a94af9671fb53a96d54279a2abc2beb6c17e3)

Then I can finally end this nightmare, quit the gambling and move on with my life. No more sleepless nights, no more insane schemes. I will finally come out on top and follow my original intentions after I made out on FRC. I am jumping into a wild ape cage posting this. I am revealing myself to be a reckless fool to the millions that believe I owe an Autism charity $10k.

113,$875 - $490k in 2 months,Gain,"Hello fellow regards.

I am the degen regard with the $52k MSFT calls (sold for 160k).

Everyone has been asking, so i will give the full story the best i can and to the point. Loss & gain porn and dopamine highly fluctuated recently.

Screenshots showing starting, all time low, and currently. (Robinhood fked up and doesnt show %, and shows -37k instead of 875 cause theres a 38k withdrawl from yesterday pending).

TLDR:
I gambled my life savings during the last 2 years, going from $217k account to just $875 2 months ago, gained 56,000% since then, currently at 490k. Im 26yr old.

2017 - Feb, 7 2021:
Starting investing with robinhood in 2017 and would deposit money pretty often, learned about options (shocker) and hit a high of 274k in Feb of 2021 (total deposits 217k).

2021 - March 20, 2023:
Trading options, meme stocks,  and tech earnings led to me losing more than 99% of my account by March 20.
I actually had $375 and deposited $500 that day. 

March 20 - Today
Began trading 0DTE QQQs and weekly AMZN and TSLA swings both calls and puts.

Yesterday i bought like 200k worth of QQQ weekly calls and 100 MSFT 280 calls ($60k) in the morning to cash on the earnings run up and sell before close, because i promised i wouldnt play earnings again (shocker #2)... Anyway i was down 34% and decided to sell.. i put in the order and only 12 calls sold, i canceled it and decided to ride earnings overnight. Woke up and sold it for $160k after market and sold the QQQ calls, account was 458k when i sold.

Right after selling i bought $10k META puts to play earnings and i bought over $275k of 3DTE and weekly QQQ Puts. My account is sitting at 506k now, running up over 57,800% since March 20, 2023.

Bottom line:
Im regarded, and i got lucky asf. Dont go trying to chase a $ without expecting to lose it all. Trust ur gut (mine usually sucks..) and remember to stay Regarded!!",2023-04-26 17:13:49,2296,Can‚Äôt relate to this post

244,Last night at 10PM (!) pacific bancorp cut its dividend from 25 cents to a penny. Are they LYING about their health like First Republic?,News,"Link: [https://www.pacwestbancorp.com/news-market-data/news/news-details/2023/PacWest-Bancorp-Announces-Quarterly-Dividends-c1460fd7b/default.aspx](https://www.pacwestbancorp.com/news-market-data/news/news-details/2023/PacWest-Bancorp-Announces-Quarterly-Dividends-c1460fd7b/default.aspx)

This is after their [confidence boosting press release](https://www.pacwestbancorp.com/news-market-data/news/news-details/2023/Pacific-Western-Bank-Issues-Update/default.aspx) from Thursday.

These banks have been god damned liars. They refuse to provide daily disclosures of deposits, even though they have the information right in front of them, and when they do have to release info it contradicts the rosy image they try to paint. Remember how First Republic lied its ass off for a month, chronology below. I mean, **why would you announce that at 10pm?! Why not during the trading hours so investors can actually USE the information to decide what to do with your shares?**

The [nerve of bankers to ask the SEC](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-bankers-urge-sec-probe-short-sales-reduce-abusive-trading-2023-05-05/) to fight ""manipulative traders."" The only one manipulating the market is the lying banks.

* On March 10, [Silicon Valley Bank failed](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/10/business/silicon-valley-bank-stock.html) after customers rushed to withdraw their money, causing its deposits to fall to an unsustainably low level, i.e. after a bank run.
* On March 12, [Signature Bank failed](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/12/business/signature-bank-collapse.html) for the same reason.
* As a result of these failures, investors became concerned about the deposits at other banks, including (a) Western Alliance Bancorporation, whose [stock price fell by 63%](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhtjj43YunMEK_cLvzVhPIEPMaIGIeCeJgf0nUjVdJdq090ErjXPO1tg569Y4fCNfZa1fZLLKuFRnGdpP1FvsrmQZNy0v3fdN5c0MNQgw3IRsxnkp2GdvIALi68rVzkyKO2bOB9j4DRR5Kx26RLK2iq-8dA9Oqp_89rjlEBuD2Rj3-6s2xRb1l0o4cH) between March 8 and March 13, (b) PacWest Bancorp, whose [stock also fell 63%](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEh2Agk_RYtAOeRTAZF4P9T_hdB82kxyisX0XHVUxGzE19yKjT4SBnuvsvuKT1OCC-4vDyjiOH5rBBXLV9T2Sqi_SYDvZuHZW1oNsz5ki9eHr7wDU38xnjzU-u6hnzzS5p_Hufg_2QRudt6gV8VKnCkwPS5hGh0Bl1hg84yLpGv37zdUmHbT9KVXpRfz) between those two dates, and (c) First Republic Bank, whose [stock fell 73%](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEh_d2AtUaEU74vDlrR_Vw08SbF-nO8csZngL69_RLeg37H23Rktk7HZ66O4lPCE77tZNyR5rQzfsp1w2o6qwSoainifshP-Kg9Pv4SHcn4gO4hPYwaemvQZWbUm89KJlDXClSFhv84hHcNwhJ6yFRObwrmBGH41b6416xw-6hth3cXem8eELZFnPeYC) between those two dates.
* To assuage investor concerns, First Republic Bank [issued a statement on March 16](https://news.firstrepublic.com/news-releases/news-release-details/reinforcing-confidence-first-republic-bank) titled, ""Reinforcing Confidence in First Republic Bank."" It said the bank would receive $30 billion of deposits from a coalition of eleven large banks committed to preserving confidence in the banking system. Notably, they did not reveal how much deposits had been withdrawn, only that $30 billion of deposits had been added.
* Based on a google search, its [press releases](https://news.firstrepublic.com/newsroom) and its [Securities and Exchange Commission filings](https://ir.firstrepublic.com/filings?gnav=globalheader;aboutus-filings), First Republic did not issue a single additional statement on its deposit situation in the ensuing month.
* On Monday April 24, First Republic was due to announce quarterly earnings in the afternoon. It would now have to disclose the amount of deposits it had lost. Presumably because the bank had said nothing for a month -- investors were optimistic and pushed the stock [from $14.27 in the morning to $16.00](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhBdfasc-f1ZvyXu_jgEgW01-Ko7Nq8GK-6BbQ5uUpXBUzNMJl2b_Oapfg3_X4YeOofS-_W1I86sOpw7K_UY3iIcRmNXE2LpvV1beNiBFITM_smYi0maJ1AaB8KdHZaIQlqx9yH6vgCgcNu3KB8iyFyphQ41xSHxzWMBHzDI5UIHCPnGNf884aZ1c-q) right before the earnings release, a 12% increase in one trading day.
* The [earnings release](https://ir.firstrepublic.com/static-files/013f57fb-b980-4353-bbb3-0e7a3b27f20a) shocked investors. Analysts had [expected on average $145 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/24/first-republic-says-deposits-tumbled-40percent-to-104point5-billion-in-1q-but-have-stabilized-since.html) in deposits, but [the bank only had about $103 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/24/first-republic-says-deposits-tumbled-40percent-to-104point5-billion-in-1q-but-have-stabilized-since.html) of deposits. And this was after the $30 billion injection from the large banks.¬†In addition, deposits had fallen to $104.5 billion [on March 31](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiWEHgGSS6dz5awGV8e9uPmoFTzgQN4AHems_mF88jOOOuPmdfVlAMt9_fU2EBmxlU-ymhjCFwnW9Y1CtYnoyJs6l6_7fp9xxv3s5tS4UiBCOuB6UIpYrTesUdDqigyP5sQj1TFdst3zNYpR1cl9rzgAlqaNf3wOo8uRrgZHL53EKZQG5AoTUfrBNc_/s918/image_2023-05-06_053345668.png), so the bank was sitting on this information for almost a month.¬†
* During the earnings call, the bank said ""deposits ha\[d\] stabilized"" and that it had plenty of liquidity. It also announced a three-part plan to ""strengthen \[its\] business"" for the future. But having lost trust in the bank's word, investors sold their positions. That night its stock fell by about 25%, and it just kept falling until the [bank had to be taken over](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/resolutions/bank-failures/failed-bank-list/first-republic.html) by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation a few days later.

Edit: To answer questions in the comments, note that Western Alliance Bancorporation did not cut dividends. On May 2, [they said they would pay](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/western-alliance-bancorp-wal-declares-$0.36-dividend) their usual $0.36 per share, with an ex date of May 11.

Edit2: It's **up 30%** premarket monday morning, and WAL (which didn't cut dividends) is only up 10%. I'm glad I realized that I don't understand these bank stocks at all and avoided buying or selling them.

Last edit: After inexplicably rising 30% during the premarket, it gave it all up during the day with a brutal 21% drop. No clue why it went up by so much and no clue why it went down by so much. I give up on these banks. They've lied so much that no one knows what's going on, which creates massive volatility due to lack of information.

One more edit: they apparently were lying because on May 11, they disclosed that ""\[d\]uring the week ended May 5, 2023, our deposits declined approximately 9.5%, with a majority of that decline occurring on May 4th and May 5th."" So on the night of May 5th, at 10PM, they issued the press release above cutting dividends and stating that they were healthy, when they knew that in the immediately preceding two days, their deposits had fallen by 10%.

Some of you know why i'm posting this here. For those who don't know, i've been trying to be some kind of prophet idiot and i've failed a lot in the past. I stopped posting for 6 months until i could better nail the market down based on certain data sets i've been analyzing for a very long time and i'm back here because i think i have managed to acomplish it.

My track record has been extremely shoddy at best for the past 2 years, but as of recent breakthroughs in understanding the data sets i have, i think i've found what i wanted.

I'm not going to mention dates or PT's. All i can say is that i figured it out in March and rode the March spike and that make things click for me. I had full ported and made avg 1300%

I'm in for 2960 option contracts. I would get more but i'm restricted on how much exposure i can have.

That's all. You'll know how this trade has gone soon enough i guess.

272,RIVN is undervalued and oversold‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm leveraged to the tits üå∞üå∞,DD,"Today I want to tell you why Rivian, the electric car company that is best known for moving people down tax brackets, is now a buy.

Scroll to the end if you want the TLDR. Also fyi not a bag holder, my cost basis is $12.60/share ($13.87 now). Full disclosure, I'm leveraged to the tits on this trade.

&#x200B;

# Trading Below Net Assets

Rivian has fallen 90% since its IPO at the end of 2021.

Rivian‚Äôs market cap is now only $13b. It has $12b of cash on hand and $14b in shareholder equity (assets minus liabilities). Its existing factory will be able to produce 150k vehicles/year when fully operational, at $75k/vehicle that will generate $11b in revenue. Its second factory is already in the works to build the next generation (R2), which will be cheaper.

For comparison, Tesla is trading 11x shareholder equity and 6.4x revenue. Tesla is a better company but not a better stock.

&#x200B;

# Rivian Actually Makes Great Cars

Marques Brownlee reviews (big tech review guy) [owns one and likes it](https://youtu.be/wR-0knMVSGw). Even its detractors say its handling is unmatched in the EV space. The SUV pickup space is the hottest sector in the US car market.

Demand for EVs is massive and will grow exponentially over the next decade. Making vehicles that look great, handle great and have some nifty features is more than enough to sell everything you can make. Rivian has years of orders with little to no marketing.

There's not too much competition, Cybertruck looks weird and isn't available yet, Ford F150 Lightning is being made in very small amounts.

They‚Äôve also gone after the delivery van space with an exclusive deal to supply Amazon. Electric vans make more sense than semi-trucks, as road weight limits reduce carrying capacity due to the weight of battery packs.

&#x200B;

# RJ Scaringe Doesn‚Äôt Have To Be A Rocket Scientist

The CEO of Rivian, RJ Scaringe, isn‚Äôt a grandstanding visionary. He‚Äôs slightly awkward, introverted and thoughtful with a genuine passion for crafting great cars. While Rivian won't be offering robotaxi trips to mars anytime soon, I'd argue they don't need to do more than make great cars for a rapidly growing market.

When an industry needs to be created or revolutionized you need visionaries who can take 0 to 1. Electric cars are coming out of that phase and into one of iterative improvement. We will increasingly need leadership with high attention to small details, who will perfect what already exists.

Rivian isn't burdened with a sky-high valuation requiring earth-shattering innovations to maintain.

&#x200B;

# Emeralds Can Crack

Being politically active on Twitter and divorced is a bad combination. What Elon craves most of all is attention and then validation. The constant dick-sucking from fringe crazies and mocking from normal people is going to drive him further out there. He doesn‚Äôt have close friends, is cut off from his family and can‚Äôt hold down a relationship. There isn‚Äôt a counterbalance in his life to stop him from getting nuttier.

This is going to bleed into the Tesla brand, particularly if he fully loses it.

&#x200B;

# EV Is Supply Constrained

Last year 750k/16m vehicles sold in the US were electric. Over the next decade EVs will reach almost 100% market share for new vehicles. The last few covid/slowdown years have been awful for car sales but EV has kept powering on despite this.

Meeting this demand is the hardest part. Heavily indebted, low multiple, traditional car companies have invested hundreds of billions into factories that are becoming obsolete. EVs are a radically different business from combustion. The Ford f150 lighting is a great car, but they shipped just 3,600 in the first couple of months of 2023. This is what creates the opening for new players that have a head start.

&#x200B;

# The Bad

Rivian is burning cash rapidly, it burnt $7b in the last year and is forecast to burn $4b this year. At this rate, it will need to raise more cash within 24 months. At the current low valuation, this would be very dilutive. They have a path to profitability but to afford rapid growth they‚Äôd need the share price to significantly recover.

The founder/CEO Scaringe looks to have sold most of his shares in the company which isn‚Äôt a sign of confidence.

Rivian doesn‚Äôt benefit from most of the massive Tesla charging network, building their own is expensive. Rivian isn‚Äôt as far along with self-driving AI.

Amazon has an exclusivity contract for the delivery vans, but they've ordered far less than originally promised. Rivian is looking to end the exclusivity agreement.

# TLDR

**Rivian has gotten killed along with the tech stocks it trades with. However, unlike tech stocks, Rivian has invested billions in hard assets, not intangible software. You can buy it so cheap that unless the business generates 0 ROI on its assets/cash, you're guaranteed to make a return.**

**Rivian makes great cars, that look incredible, in the hottest sector of the car market (SUV/pickups), in the exponentially growing EV space. They're benefitting from so many tailwinds, yet the stock is priced below net assets. Even with the challenge of raising fresh funds, their burn rate is decreasing, much of the heavy investment is already done and they have years of runway.**

**It's very difficult to see how this could go much lower, and it is very easy to see how it could go much higher. I foresee it being many multiples of its current value within a year or two.**

In the end, shareholders had to sell their WAL shares (and other bank shares) at a massive loss to cut potential heavier losses, only to see the stock prices back up once the FT news article was deemed fake.

The American Bankers Association urged federal regulators to investigate  a spate of significant short sales of publicly traded banking equities  that it said were disconnected from the underlying financial realities.  It also observed extensive social media engagement about the health of  various banks that was out of step with general industry conditions.  Short sellers raked in $378.9 million in paper profits on Thursday alone  from betting against certain regional banks. The ABA includes small,  regional and large banks that employ more than 2 million people,  safeguard $19.2 trillion in deposits and extend $12.2 trillion in loans.  The S&P 600 bank index dropped more than 3% on Thursday. The SEC  should reinforce its efforts to address abusive short campaigns and go  after any misconduct that could threaten investors or markets.

310,"ChatGPT Can Decode Fed Speak, Predict Stock Moves From Headlines",News,"Artificial intelligence has clearly been thriving. The capabilities of AI tools like ChatGPT justify the fervor surrounding the technology. From clearing exams to posing as a potential threat to several jobs, ChatGPT is advancing at an impeccable rate. Alongside its other capacities, a new report highlights how the AI tool can now predict stock moves.

According to Bloomberg, ChatGPT can now foretell the fate of stocks based on article headlines.

ChatGPT was employed to carry out market-relevant tasks, and two studies about the same were released. One of the studies used the chatbot to determine if Federal Reserve pronouncements were aggressive or meek, and the other to determine whether stock-related headlines were favorable or unfavorable.

The AI chatbot cleared both the above-mentioned tests. This further highlighted how a multitude of text from news articles, tweets, and even speeches could be converted into trading signals.

**Here‚Äôs how ChatGPT was used to determine the movement of the stock market:**

The title of the second study was ‚ÄúCan ChatGPT Forecast Stock Price Movements? Return Predictability and Large Language Models.‚Äù The University of Florida‚Äôs Alejandro Lopez-Lira and Yuehua Tang prompted ChatGPT to pose as a financial professional. Following this, they asked the chatbot to analyze business news articles. Since the chatbot‚Äôs training data didn‚Äôt cover the time after late 2021, they employed news from that time period.

The study discovered a statistical relationship between the stock‚Äôs future movements and the replies provided by ChatGPT. This further indicates that the technology was able to accurately comprehend the significance of the news. Bloomberg went on to share an instance from the study,

‚ÄúIn an example about whether the headline ‚ÄúRimini Street Fined $630,000 in Case Against Oracle‚Äù was good or bad for Oracle, ChatGPT explained that it was positive because the penalty ‚Äúcould potentially boost investor confidence in Oracle‚Äôs ability to protect its intellectual property and increase demand for its products and services.‚Äù

Furthermore, it should be noted that this is not new on Wall Street. Analysts have been using the same language models that underpin the chatbot to guide several strategies. However, the results suggest that OpenAI‚Äôs technology is now capable of understanding subtlety and context at a higher degree than ever before.

Slavi Marinov, head of machine learning at Man AHL, addressed the same and said,

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the rare cases where the hype is real.‚Äù

320,How I Turned Market Volatility into a $375k Windfall: My VIX Trading Strategy Revealed! (With More Data and Enhanced Strategy!,Discussion,"I'm back with an even more detailed look at my VIX trading strategy that led me to $375,000 in profits. Thanks to your insightful comments, I've further refined my strategy and uncovered additional patterns from my dataset, which spans 16 years of market data. Let's dive deeper into the analysis and explore the enhanced strategy!

**The Data**

As a reminder, I analyzed 16 years of VIX, SPX, and market indicators data from 2005 to 2021. The dataset included:

* Daily VIX and SPX closing prices
* Gamma highs and lows
* 50, 100, and 200-day moving averages
* Moon phases (full moon and new moon dates)

**Key Insights and Revisions**

With your comments in mind, I revisited the dataset and discovered even more fascinating patterns that further strengthened my strategy:

1. From 2005 to 2021, on average, the VIX increased by 3.57% during new moons and decreased by 2.81% during full moons. This trend persisted across various market conditions and reinforced my decision to use moon phases in my trading strategy. As u/5JeepHardRock pointed out, full moons occur approximately every 29.5 days, which helped me better time my trades.
2. The inverse relationship between the VIX and SPX was particularly strong during significant market events. For instance, during the 2008 financial crisis, the VIX reached an all-time high of 80.86, while the SPX plummeted by more than 50%. This insight was crucial in helping me identify opportunities to short the SPX and buy VIX call options.
3. In the 16-year dataset, there were 27 instances where the Gamma spread was above 85. In 22 of these instances (81.48%), the VIX experienced a decline within the next 3 to 5 trading days, providing a perfect setup for my Thunder Call spreads.
4. Bullish markets saw an average VIX decline of 4.92% when the 50-day moving average crossed below the 200-day moving average. This pattern helped me time my Thunder Put trades to capitalize on potential market reversals.
5. As u/Winter-Efficiency598 mentioned, I didn't make any significant gains in 2021. This is because the VIX was essentially flat during that year. However, I consider it a win, as my strategy helped me avoid unnecessary trades and potential losses in a volatile market.

**The Enhanced Strategy**

With the newfound insights and revisions, I've refined my initial strategy as follows:

1. During new moons, I shorted the SPX and bought VIX call options.
2. During full moons, I engaged in long puts on the VIX (Lightning Puts).
3. If a full moon occurred and the Gamma spread was 85 or higher, I entered a Thunder Call spread.
4. In bullish markets, I timed my Thunder Put trades to coincide with the 50-day moving average crossing below the 200-day moving average.
5. In periods of low VIX movement, such as 2021, I exercised patience and avoided unnecessary trades.

**Further Opportunities**

u/Comicdn and u/Affectionate_Fix8401 suggested that I could also explore potential squeeze/pump plays alongside my complex options trading. This is an excellent idea that could potentially boost my profits even further. I plan to delve into this area and share my findings with you all soon.

**Final Thoughts**  


 The more data you have, the better equipped you are to make informed trading decisions. By analyzing 16 years of VIX, SPX, and market indicators data, I was able to create a robust strategy that led me to a $375,000 profit. Your comments and feedback have been invaluable in refining and enhancing my approach.

Remember, investing is a journey of constant learning and adaptation. Be open to new ideas and strategies, and always strive to improve your understanding of the markets. Thank you all for your insights, and I look forward to continuing this conversation and learning from each other.

Good luck, and happy trading!

P.S. As for the Jugo ETF idea from u/Winter-Efficiency598, who knows? Maybe one day, we can all collaborate to launch it together.  

Edit to the original post:

Update: Some people have mentioned that they think I'm joking because of the funny names I've used for my strategies. Let me clarify my approach.

To keep things straight, I come up with memorable names for my findings and then use data science to validate my hypotheses. If a hypothesis fails, I set it aside in case I can use a portion of it within another strategy or as a precursor. I like to think of strategies as switches in a house. You need to have multiple switches, but if they're all on, you're being wasteful. If you only have one on, you can't see clearly. The goal is to have a few on for the room you're in, setting the right vibe.

In other words, each strategy is not always engaged. They all have their own on/off switches and dimmers, as well as a master kill switch and a full-house surge protector. This approach allows me to adapt and optimize my trading strategies based on current market conditions.

\---Most  of the major film making Union strikes, WGA, SAG, DGA  along with all  of the large U.S. market crashes on a visual chart. 8/9 of the last times.

lets see if this holds up.

\---Almost every major Hollywood strike has happened either immediately before or soon after a major U.S. market or economic crash dating back as early as 1973.

\---Strikes take time to play out. The strike starts tomorrow and means the WGA has been at it since last year or more.

\--- I believe this could be  leading Indicator for what's to come if history repeats itself.

Note there was a lot more going on during these times including high inflation, drop in GDP and higher unemployment.

\---WGA 1973 Strike--- 1973 U.S. Market crash, U.S. recession, Global oil crisis.

\---SAG 1980 -WGA 1981 Strike---  1980-81 U.S.Recession.

\---DGA/WGA / SAG 1987-88 Strike---1987 Black Monday U.S. market crash.

\----WGA Strike 2007-08----U.S. Stock market crash, Global Financial Crisis-Subprime mortgage crisis.

\----WGA Strike 2023?---- Global Financial Crisis?....U.S. Market crash?......

The U.S. DJIA is only 2,900 away from a new all time high, yet this does not truly paint the current economic state the world or U.S.  economy  is  in....

Obviously when the economy is in a hard place the unions are there to help protect their members.

The strike really has more to do with streaming residuals than it does with the ceo pay. Yes, there is a vast contrast between a CEO‚Äôs pay and a writers. Let me be clear the writers are not underpaid. They are also trying to restructure their length of pay. (See attached contract) The negotiations are no where near close to coming to an agreement.

Let me also mention SAG and DGA contracts are set to expire June 30th. Are the studios going to start handing out shows when there could be a potential second strike? Definitely not. This could be another 3-4 month strike which would cause lots of production workers to potentially lose their homes or leave the business entirely. Interesting correlation between writers strikes and economic crashes. Will buy some puts just in case. Hope this helps.

353,You have less than one week to get in on FRC before earnings release üöÄüöÄüöÄ,Discussion,"FRC is due to release their earnings on April 24th. That means you degenerates have less than a week to get in on FRC on the ground floor before the earnings release. Some time ago, I posted my analysis as to why I believe FRC is the biggest bargain of the decade. Read it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12hp63d/comment/jfpw63k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), it will open your eyes to the games being played on the general public.

In it, I explained why the time to get in on FRC is before the earnings report. It's too damn late if you wait until after 4/24.  The reason for that is because the market expects FRC to be fucked. It's priced in. Bears and shorts have taken over the media and narrative and the sentiment is wildly negative, so when the earning comes out, if it turns out FRC is fucked, well everyone already expected that so who cares. But on the other hand if it turns out that FRC is in better shape than everyone expected, the stock will shoot up as the entire country heave a huge sigh of relief. We're already seeing the start of a comeback after news from another regional bank Western Alliance isn't nearly as bad as the media made it out to be. The bears are scrambling to cover. FRC itself is up over 10% today on that news alone and the storm hasn't even hit yet.

Your entire life has been one long string of fuck ups and missed or squandered opportunities. Don't let this be another one.

FRC is due to release their earnings on April 24th. That means you degenerates have less than 48 hours to get in FRC on the ground floor before earnings come out on April 24th.

I posted my analysis as to why I believe FRC is the biggest bargain of the decade. Read it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12hp63d/comment/jfpw63k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), it will open your eyes to the games being played on the general public (I'll post it in the comments too). I still get dozens of messages every day asking if I changed my opinion and if I've sold. No, I have not. I have not changed my stance one inch and neither have I sold a single share of FRC even though as of today I'm in the money and can walk away with a nice little profit. But I ain't about little profits, I'm about big profits and since I truly think that FRC can touch the moon, why sell now? üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Everything I wrote in that piece is as true today as when it was written, if not truer. Fear is in the air, blood is on the streets, and uncertainty reigns. The hedges and media friend‚Äôs attacks on FRC and regional banks have continued, though it's getting a little old by now. However, the sentiment is still unbelievably negative and fear driven. The expectation is that FRC is royalty fucked, that this thing is nanometers away from failure and total bankruptcy. That is baked into the price. But we've already seen that regional banks' numbers are fairly [good](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12t7ilq/the_average_deposits_of_regional_banks_in_q1/). This news hasn't had time to propagate through the market just yet, but it will soon.

Come April 24th, we will find out one of two things: Either FRC is as royally fucked as everyone expects, in which case everyone shrugs and says ""knew it"" (the price might still go down a bit), or FRC turns out better than expected, in which case absolute pandemonium ensures. The range for this second scenario can be ""FRC's situation a little bit better than expected"" or ""god damn this thing is actually doing really well!"" or anywhere between. Read my analysis then take a nice, careful look at the below graph and tell me which scenario you think will happen:

Remember, this is a long play, so I advise against buying options. Just buy shares.

Your entire life has been one long string of fuck ups and missed or squandered opportunities. You know it, your grandma knows it, and we know it. Will you let this be another one?

361,"Following up on my prior post, undeniable proof that Pacific West absolutely was LYING",News,"To summarize what happened.

On May 3, Pacific West [issued a press release](https://www.pacwestbancorp.com/news-market-data/news/news-details/2023/Pacific-Western-Bank-Issues-Update/default.aspx) stating that all was good.

On Friday May 5, at 10pm,  [it said it would cut dividends](https://www.pacwestbancorp.com/news-market-data/news/news-details/2023/PacWest-Bancorp-Announces-Quarterly-Dividends-c1460fd7b/default.aspx) from 25 cents to a penny, but again that all was good. That prompted my [post asking](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/139kgyk/last_night_at_10pm_pacific_bancorp_cut_its/) if it was lying, because the 10PM timing of that release sure did seem suspicious, not to mention its ""all is good but oh we're cutting dividends any way"" content.

Now, in their [SEC 10K quarterly filing](https://www.pacwestbancorp.com/sec-filings/public-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=16642121) \-- that they filed late last night -- the truth comes out. It states that, ""\[d\]uring the week ended May 5, 2023, our deposits declined approximately 9.5%, with a majority of that decline occurring on May 4th and May 5th."" **So on the night of May 5th, at 10PM, they knew that in the preceding two days, their deposits had fallen by 10%.** The failure to disclose the deposit outflow was IMHO a lie and it probably cost some poor trusting bank bulls money this week. (The stock is down 20% in the premarket this morning.)

This is after the chicanery of First Republic ([chronology in](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/139kgyk/last_night_at_10pm_pacific_bancorp_cut_its/) the original post).

I really wish these banks would stop blaming [short sellers](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/short-selling-comes-under-fire-regional-banks-sell-off-2023-05-04/), or [""abusive trading""](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-bankers-urge-sec-probe-short-sales-reduce-abusive-trading-2023-05-05/) for their problems when all of the volatility we see in bank stocks is caused by the fact that we can't trust anything they say. .

https://preview.redd.it/bfcyawgqteza1.jpg?width=271&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e2c3fd134baab3fed1ae393bbacd880d384adc34

THE 10 GOLDEN RULES OF TRADING

I've been in the option business for a very long time and you cannot learn the skill of trading overnight. To be a master it takes years and TBH, I certainly cannot claim to have mastered options, but I do know them. When you do progress to becoming a consistently profitable trader it can be a very rewarding experience and I have learned along the way that there are certain rules that need to be adhered to. Some, you may think are obvious but I can tell you, I have seen other people break every single one and everyone will likely have done at least one of them at one point, if you end up doing this long enough...

1. MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS!

Do not enter a trade just because someone else told you to! Do your own research, you need to know everything about the trade you are entering,

2. ALWAYS TRADE WITH A STOP LOSS OR MAX LOSS IN MIND.

Before you enter a trade , already KNOW what you are prepared to lose on it and it should ALWAYS be less than you are hoping to make. (I would suggest as a guide that your loss should be no more than 50% of what you are hoping to make. Your stop loss can either be set based on technical, events or based on your affordability. It should basically reflect the loss that you are willing to accept to lose on a position. Irrespective of whether you are trading on the long side or on the short side, always you need to have that level where the position is just wrong and you need to have that discipline to exit a loser. (The only addendum I would add to this is that with equities or futures, you can put in an electronic stop which once placed, takes out the emotion of having to exit yourself, however, I would advise not to put it (stop-loss) in on an electronic platform option strategy, because it will likely get triggered when it shouldn't have due to liquidity. In this instance, if you have a system that can evaluate your option position at any given time, you will be able to see where the value is, so just know where your stop-loss level is and if your theo value gets there then you have to have the discipline to get out.) Which brings me to...

3. DISCIPLINE!

Do not move your stop-loss. If it gets triggered, accept it and walk away. The same can be said for booking profits. Profit is what is booked; all else is book profits. Keep taking your money off the table at regular intervals. There is NOTHING WRONG with making a profit. YOu may see something go further afterward, but that's fine, you have MADE MONEY and that's all that counts. I personally would use a trailing stop, which moves up along with my profitable trade.

4. NEVER LET A WINNING TRADE TURN INTO A LOSING ONE.

As I mentioned above, I have used a stop that moves up with my winners (eg; I book the profit if it retraces 10% off any recent high if it hasn't got to my target) but once clear and in the money at the very least put in a stop that will get you out for no loss.

5. NEVER CHASE/ADD TO A LOSER

Do not add to your position if your position is losing and you cant bear to take a loss, this is not a winning strategy. If your strategy is to average into a trade over a price range then that is totally fine, but doubling down in the hope the market will turn will burn you to the ground eventually.

6. DON'T LOOK BACK IN ANGER

This is very important especially if you have had to book a loss. Traders tend to look back and over analyse. Also, when traders book profits and the stock goes further up, they tend to look back at the notional losses. Both are not advisable as they tend to detract from your core trading strategy.

7. DON'T OVERTRADE/TRADE OUT OF BOREDOM.

Not trading is also a strategy. This is something most traders tend to miss. Traders believe that trading strategy either means to buy or to sell in the market. But the most productive strategy can be to not do anything. This is very relevant when the market is very confusing and traders can get hit either way. Have your own plan and STICK TO IT!

8. COSTS SHOULD BE CALCULATED INTO YOUR STRATEGY

Remember, when you trade your cost is not just the brokerage you pay. There are all kinds of other charges like stamp duty, turnover tax, exchange fees etc. If you take delivery of shares, there are also expenses related to your account. The point being, that I know of traders who have grossed over $2mil at a firm and seen every penny of it eaten up by costs. And then there is margin. For all of you options and futures traders and anyone else who trades on margin, you should have a good understanding of how changes in a position may require more money to maintain them, even if they are doing well. All these costs and how margin changes (how much capital you'll need to maintain the position) over time need to be factored in when you project your trading profits and entering the trade.

9. BE AWARE OF OVERNIGHT RISK

Decide on a strategy that you like and stick with it market. Positions are normally intraday or for a few days. One of the biggest risks you need to be conscious of if the overnight risk. When there is uncertainty on the economic or geopolitical risk or there is a major event coming up, it is always advisable to be as light in the market as possible or at least understand what you really have at risk if things go pear-shaped but you're not there to do anything about it.

10. STAY ON THE SIDE OF MOMENTUM

When you are a trader, trend is your friend. You are more likely to make money as a trader if you trade according to the momentum. Trying to short a bull market does not make sense. Similarly, trying to catch a falling knife is also not the right idea. You trading strategy should be aligned to the direction of the momentum.

Remember that there is NO WISHING, HOPING OR PRAYING. This isnt a game, you are here to make money. Decide on a strategy that you like and stick with it. If you stick to rules, learn from your mistakes, be humble and respect the market and you will become a successful trader.

I have been on a bit of a downward spiral (was still playing with gains for past month) when I was sitting on a 4x-5x of 7800 SPY puts (changed too fast but gains were about 600k+ when I tried to close).  I had been burned on CPI before (see other posts about losing 210k in about 4 seconds last year) so bought some puts as a hedge on other positions and DCAd a bit too aggressively and ended up with 7800 contracts at a price of \~.17.  Lots were 10s of thousands on bid/ask but when I tried to close, it shrank to 1 to 50 and the candle would jump on each limit order (had to market sell) as this is approx $300,000,000 in notional value.  (Schwab also sucks balls on option order execution).  Instead of 600k+ in gains, I ended up closing for 15k in gains with a hurt mojo at the money I could have had and had fun losing later.

Last week I wanted to enter an iron condor but by the time my money swept from my futures account, it was too late.

On this Monday around open, I entered into a slightly bullish Iron Condor of 9000 contracts with expiry 5/1 and then jumped on a 4 hour plane trip which was delayed 2 hours without wifi, fingers crossed.

Strikes were:Long 2250 SPY 409pShort 2250 SPY 413pShort 2250 SPY -414cLong  2250 SPY 418c

Break even was 410.xx on low end and 416.xx on upper end.  Max gain was \~700k if spy closed between 413 and 414 on 5/1.  Max loss was \~300k.

[Iron Condor entry](https://preview.redd.it/eprp1x3qphwa1.png?width=2612&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f428a6ba618cdb770619002304817546d59116d6)

Monday went OK.  Tuesday and Wednesday killed me...  Max loss.  I decided to leg out of the calls leaving \~60k on the table on the gains side in case it bounced back.

Was now down over 300k yesterday and Schwab flashed a ""total lose of 750k"" on screen.  I assumed this is normal as their % stuff is shit and nearly always wrong, and I usually just watch account balance. In the middle of the night it showed account balance going from 1.1m to 400k.  I got a tad worried as no calls, no emails no notifications.  Found out at 5am EST that 884 of by 413p I shorted were assigned early, and I was now long 88,400 shares of SPY which I sold at 413 overnight as there was no time value left on the 413p.   The extra loss was due to a reporting error in their shit UI.

I proceed to call Schwab and was alerted that I was now holding \~$36,000,000 of SPY in an account with \~$1m and had a $17,000,000 margin call

I was a bit worried they would sell the shares pre market or after open all at once on a market order, leaving me lopsided with my 409p in a rising market (this was worth \~$1.2m around close yesterday).  Schwab encouraged me to exercise the 409s but I said I would watch GDP first as there may be time value left with the market rising.  Market kept going up, sure enough there was.  Reminder, check time value when exercising.

At open I had to have a broker on the phone for 90min while I slow walked sell orders of shares/puts to not be lopsided in the trade and tried to get benefit of the rising market.  I obviously wanted to keep them as long as possible as my max downside was already hit and I could only go up (assuming they didn't market sell the shares and leave my long puts or exercise for me, killing about 250k in time value).  I hand typed sell orders in lots of 1000-4000 for shares/puts for 90 min with a broker on the phone who was also talking to risk management.  Dude was seriously the most helpful person ever.

The exercise cost me about 300k-600k (who knows exactly with their shitty UI) in additional gains today on top of the 900k since I could not hold them due to not having $17m under my mattress that I could send on a moment notice.

The remaining of gains today was some revenge trading of about 8000 SPY call options at couple strikes which I bought Wednesday night.

If you've been lurking around here, you probably know who I am. I'm the ""idiot"" who bought 5000 shares of FRC üöÄüöÄüöÄ then wrote an analysis of why I did so. Read it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12hp63d/comment/jfpw63k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

I have also been keeping close tab of general sentiment on FRC üöÄüöÄüöÄ so when I started noticing more and more headlines like these popping up in recent days/weeks my gifted brain switched into high gear. Take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/z4yegokvsjva1.png?width=3564&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2a765698636f410721b262f6e18884d63f57af24

See the pattern?

It's pretty fucked. Whatever is going on over at FRC üöÄüöÄüöÄ, it ain't pretty, according to your friendly media and their hedge fund friends. You should dump it, you know, because it's fucked up. Like cocaine. It's bad for you. Matter of fact, between investing in FRC üöÄüöÄüöÄ and cocaine, the latter is preferable any day, according to the media. 

Even the highly regarded Moody's Corporation, with a historical record of being always right and always prescient in everything they say/do, downgraded FRC several times (currently at ""junk"" status), which basically translates to ""between buying this shit and overdosing on cocaine, we recommend cocaine""

Not only is mainstream media overwhelmingly bearish/negative on FRC üöÄüöÄüöÄ, but WSB is too! Just look around. Even on posts authored by me, ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12s6xmg/you_have_less_than_one_week_to_get_in_on_frc/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12ufinh/degenerates_you_have_less_than_48_hours_to_get_in/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)),  if you go through the top comments, they're essentially variations of ""this guy is going to lose his shirt"", ""loss porn coming soon"", and ""Wendy's"". I still get countless messages everyday asking if I regretted my decisions, if I cried to mommy, or pussied out and paperhanded.

To answer your question in the affirmative: No, I have not. I have not changed my stance or my opinion by one inch and I have not sold a single share even though I'm in the money. Like I said before, I ain't about little profits, I'm about big profits and since I truly think that FRC can touch the moon, why sell now? üöÄüöÄüöÄ

In other words, while WSB and the entire world expects to see FRC fucked in every hole, here is lonely little me, trillionairekid, one lonely soul speaking up in favor of this stock in a sea of naysayers, and going against massive headwinds from every direction. If it wasn't for me, the narrative about FRC on WSB would be overwhelmingly negative, a narrative dominated by the hedgies and their media friends, who of course has massive short positions on FRC stand and has everything to gain from FRC going titsup. 

""But, trillionairekid, if everyone is bearish on this stock, what makes you bullish???"" Good question degenerates. I explained it in my original analysis, but what I didn't say there is that I understand the fundamental truth which is that this game ain't a popularity contest. It ain't about going along with the fucking sheep herd, led by the nose by the hedgies and their media friends. The name of the game is to **INVERSE.** Run when the everyone tells you to buy, buy when everyone tells you to run. ""The time to buy is when there's blood in the streets."" I believe I alone have played a considerable part in reversing the prevailing narrative towards FRC especially on WSB, and the trend has somewhat improved over the past week, but the sentiment about FRC on WSB and everywhere else is still ***extremely*** negative and bearish. 

I invite you to study my posts:

And make up your own mind. FRC üöÄüöÄüöÄ is scheduled to release their earnings after markets close April 24, 2023 4:30 pm EDT, which gives you only a few more hours to get in, if you choose to do so. 

Although I don't have a crystal ball and don't know what will happen after the reveal, whether FRC tanks, stays flat, or explodes into the 11th dimension, I can look in the mirror proud of the fact that I had the balls and the courage to think and act for myself, and to take a stand when most sit on the sidelines. Fortune favors the bold.

**CPI**

So everyone wants to know‚Ä¶ CPI what will it be and where is it going next? And most importantly how will the market react‚Ä¶ 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qy8ssj6y8vya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=866aedc7efbc142cdf03e4db30c171dbaedf67ca

Based on my analysis here these are the probable numbers we shall see tomorrow‚Ä¶ but of course here is my actual prediction‚Ä¶ 

CPI YoY- 5.1%  
 CPI MoM- 0.5%  
 CORE YoY- 5.5%  
 CORE MoM- 0.4%

So now the biggest question would be‚Ä¶ how is the market going to react? 

Well currently the market in my opinion expects CPI (inflation) to continue to unwind‚Ä¶ they expect that inflation is under control and will continue to unwind straight to that magical 2% area‚Ä¶ well in doing so they have put themselves in a TERRIBLE position‚Ä¶ why? Well the markets have priced themselves into a corner where they see a pause in June‚Ä¶ no hike/ cut in July‚Ä¶ then 3 cuts at the meetings after to get to a 425-450 fed funds rate by end of year‚Ä¶

Whats the issue with this? Well its simple‚Ä¶ IF CPI rebounds or shows any signs of plateauing‚Ä¶ whats the reaction going to be? Well they are going to have to price in a 25bps rate HIKE at the June meeting‚Ä¶ and that is going to mess up all of this markets plan for 75bps of cuts by EOY. 

If CPI comes in hot on YoY and Mom tomorrow in my opinion we are looking at a true 2-3% melt down and not only that but we are going to continue to sell off the rest of the week‚Ä¶ the only thing that could stop that is a cool PPI print the next morning. 

If markets has to reprice their fed funds rate by EOY this could be the catalyst markets have truly been waiting for. 

Now if I am wrong and we get a CPI of 4.9% or lower‚Ä¶ well lets just say we are probably going to see a rocket ship to 440 within a very short period of time‚Ä¶

SPY daily did not establish a new supply at 412.99 as I was expecting it too‚Ä¶ though tomorrow if it is red we should establish a new one there‚Ä¶ 

I see that we closed directly in the middle of this range‚Ä¶ that means our upside target is really 415.56 to 417.03 and our downside target is 404.3 to 405.06. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qi4xaggz8vya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f9fe75464829482cbf4c40084c584d435b5e7309

Absolutely BRUTAL price action today with no continuation and lots and lots of tight ranges‚Ä¶ we spent an hour an 6 cent range at one point‚Ä¶ 

We have a major downside support at 405.2 then 399 and we have a major upside resistance at 416.8 then 419.5. 

Possible CPI Targets

Bulls- 416.84 (1.45%+) -> 419.5 (2.08%+)

Bears- 405.2 (-1.4%) -> 401.4 (-2.33%) -> 399 (-2.93%)

For me I don‚Äôt think that the upside case is there for me as VIX is so low and really CPI is already EXPECTED to come in lower and lower‚Ä¶ a surprise upside beat especially that 5.1% im looking for with MoM rising would absolutely start a huge leg down though‚Ä¶ for me im bearish. 

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Now interestingly enough futures DID turn 4152 into a new supply (resistance) which means that our target should be 4073 minimum but I still am eyeing that 4040/4055 supplies that we have come ever so close to so many times‚Ä¶ 

If we get an upside beat tomorrow then we would look for 4190-4198. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

Futures impressively only put in a 22 point range today‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a very small movement for nearly 24 hours of trading‚Ä¶ 

CPI potential targets

Bulls- 4198 (1.51%+) -> 4237 (2.4%)  
 Bears- 4073 (-1.53%) -> 4055 (-2.01%) -> 4040 (-2.34%)

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jws3dca19vya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dce6078b4bc6bdde11c8f175352e620419407da9

Started tracking the VIX on TOS and idk why just sometimes it just looks nicer then TV‚Ä¶ maybe it‚Äôs the dark mode‚Ä¶ jk light mode for life! 

Anyways the VIX continues to hold just under that daily 20ema. You can see we are really in a diamond pattern here which means if we can break through 20.42 (+15.4%) tomorrow then we might actually be looking at a bigger upside push to 22.6 to 24.18‚Ä¶ if that happens then we are looking at a fairly big dump on SPY which would correlate with a CPI miss‚Ä¶

However, if we break support tomorrow of 17.32 then we are going to look to target 15.72 support once again.

Fun fact‚Ä¶ this is the LOWEST the VIX has closed pre-CPI in over a year of CPI releases‚Ä¶ 

Once again the risk is to the downside not the upside‚Ä¶ actually something else that is incredibly impressive to me is the fact that the IV on 1dte contracts for tomorrow closed under 20%... that‚Äôs incredibly low‚Ä¶ I remember a time when SPX ATM contracts were like $4000/ play‚Ä¶ you had to go almost 20 strikes OTM just to get a lotto sized play‚Ä¶ IV used to easily hit 80-100% on CPI days‚Ä¶ IF we get a big miss and surprises tomorrow puts might see some fireworks. 

I did not open up longer term (60dte) puts today‚Ä¶ I wanted to but with the cheap 1dte I decided to swing a 1dte put instead‚Ä¶ my thoughts here is that if we miss I will win big‚Ä¶ if we beat with IV this lower and only being a handful of strikes OTM with the probability of another flat open I should be able to get out relatively unscathed‚Ä¶ I would then look for the 418-420 range to start a long term bearish play.

The bank's capital ratios are as follows:

Tier 1 leverage ratio: 8.25% (This ratio is not a FDIC capital adequacy ratio; it's a supplementary measure of capital that compares Tier 1 capital to a bank's average total consolidated assets.

Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio: 9.32% (Above the minimum requirement of 4.5%)

Total risk-based capital ratio: 12.71% (Above the minimum requirement of 8.0%)

486,First Republic most likely headed for FDIC receivership,Discussion,"Shares of First Republic dropped sharply on Friday as hopes dimmed for a rescue deal that could keep the bank afloat.

Sources told CNBC David Faber that the most likely outcome for the troubled bank is for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to take it into receivership. The stock was down 20% after being halted for volatility.

The stock has fallen more than 90% this year as investors have lost confidence in the bank after two regional lenders failed in March.

There is still hope for a solution that doesn‚Äôt include receivership, sources told Faber. First Republic told Faber on Friday that ‚Äúwe are engaged in discussions with multiple parties about our strategic options while continuing to serve our clients.‚Äù

CNBC reported on Wednesday that First Republic‚Äôs advisors were preparing to pitch larger banks on a plan that would let the regional lender sell bonds and other assets at an above-market rate and then raise equity. The sales would result in a loss for the banks that buy the bonds, but could be cheaper long-term than letting the bank fail and get seized by regulators.

Reuters reported on Friday that U.S. officials ‚Äî including from the FDIC, Treasury Department and Federal Reserve ‚Äî are coordinating meetings with other banks to broker a rescue plan for First Republic.

Shares of First Republic closed at $16 on Monday before the bank reported its first-quarter results, which showed a decline in deposits of about 40%. The stock fell more than 60% over the next two days, hitting a new all-time low.

First Republic is a regional bank that has focused on high-net-worth individuals and their businesses, offering mortgages at low interest rates.

Those mortgages, as well as other long-term assets on the bank‚Äôs balance sheet, have fallen in market value since the Fed began hiking rates last year, making investors worried that the bank would have to book a sizeable loss if forced to sell those assets to raise cash.

The bank‚Äôs massive deposit outflows came after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March.

TL;DR ‚Äì We are facing an economic collapse on multiple fronts. Safe-haven assets such as cash and precious metals will shine as the best option moving into the coming economic storm. A lot of people will learn the hard way that stocks DON‚ÄôT always go up.

We are facing several economic headwinds such as the debt ceiling debacle, a transition to ‚Äúgreen‚Äù alternatives, threats of de-dollarization, the world of crypto and its role in the future, sky high house prices and the beginnings of a banking crisis as consumers buckle under high interest rates. So how does one navigate all these issues? Where should you put your money? Not in stocks‚Ä¶ yet. As the pendulum swings left to right and right to left so the marker moves in cycles. History always repeats itself just in different forms following different timelines. This is because human nature does not change.

**Bubbles**

The aggregate US market value right now is roughly $43.89T versus the annualized GDP is roughly 26.58T. The US market value is an absolutely staggering figure at 165% higher than annualized GDP. This model is often referred to as the Buffett indicator. The value of the market is over one half larger than the economy. This is considerably higher than the market has ever stood (sustainably) in modern history‚Äîhigher, even, than the peak of the Great Bubble of 1929. The stock market is forward looking yes but the economy will have to increase by over 60% for stocks to be valued fairly or the value of the market would have to fall by 40% before this indicator shows a FAIRLY priced market. How likely is this increase in the near(ish) future? I put odds at 0%.

The recent market rally looks great for many, however the classic dead cat bounce serves as a word of caution to those who know what next chapter of this story holds.

It reminds me a little of that story of the oil prospector who died and went to heaven. And St. Peter said, ‚ÄòWell, I checked you out, and you meet all of the qualifications. But there‚Äôs one problem.‚Äô He said, ‚ÄòWe have some tough zoning laws up here, and we keep all of the oil prospectors over in that pen. And as you can see, it is absolutely chock-full. There is no room for you.‚Äú And the prospector said, ‚ÄòDo you mind if I just say four words?‚Äô ‚ÄúSt. Peter said, ‚ÄòNo harm in that. ‚ÄúSo the prospector cupped his hands and yells out, ‚ÄòOil discovered in hell! ‚ÄúAnd of course, the lock comes off the cage and all of the oil prospectors start heading right straight down. ‚ÄúSt. Peter said, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs a pretty slick trick. So,‚Äô he says, ‚Äògo on in, make yourself at home. All the room in the world. ‚ÄúThe prospector paused for a minute, then said, ‚ÄòNo, I think I‚Äôll go along with the rest of the boys. There might be some truth to that rumor after all. ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs the way people feel with stocks. It‚Äôs very easy to believe that there‚Äôs some truth to that rumor after all.‚Äù

**The tech bubble.** Valuations for tech companies soared as investors piled into ‚Äúthe next big thing‚Äù As of mid-2001, Since the market‚Äôs peak in March 2000 over four trillion dollars of stock-market value had evaporated. At least 112,000 dotcom employees had been fired. Amazon was trading at $17 down from its all time high of $113. The tech bubble had popped and value investors were sorting through the wreckage looking for companies with value that could survive. Over the two decades since billions were made on the back of this collapse, but the collapse had to happen first.

**Auto Bubble** ‚ÄúIn the early 1900s there were two-thousand auto companies in the United state. The most important invention, probably, of the first half of the twentieth century. It had an enormous impact on people‚Äôs lives. If you had seen at the time of the first cars how this country would develop in connection with autos, you would have said, ‚ÄòThis is the place I must be.‚Äô But of the two thousand companies, as of a few years ago, only three car companies survived. And, at one time or another, all three were selling for less than book value, which is the amount of money that had been put into the companies and left there. So autos had an enormous impact on America, but in the opposite direction on investors.‚Äù ‚Äì Warren Buffet

While things like cryptocurrency, AI and Evs seems to be the hallmarks for future business investment I would approach with caution. Mass speculation over each industry has fueled sky high valuations of these sectors and, while one may argue crypto has already corrected, these industries are still being defined and a washout of the ‚Äúweaker‚Äù players is still imminent.

**Crypto.** People love bitcoin and other coins because of their utilities but these assets have high price fluctuations and while some people love the risk, few have seen a realized reward. people keep piling money in because crypto is the future right? The fact of the matter is a lot of people are risk averse, they want something stable. As countries create their own digital currencies (Texas is advancing a Gold backed digital currency bill) these options are most likely to be adopted by the general public. I am sure a few apes, drug dealers and others will still use BTC or whatever other crypto rises from the ashes but its utility will most likely be limited to some degree. A digital greenback is likely.

**EVs**. While Tesla is most likely not going anywhere the EV race will see some losers. Legacy automakers are pilling millions upon millions into developing their own EV tech. The are only so many people buying cars and only so much market share to go around. When you buy companies that trade at astronomical P/Es you are expecting and investing in their future growth. Be aware of the pitfalls of greed and realistic in regards to what companies can actually achieve. The other issue faced by the idea of EVs is infrastructure. City grids have not been built to accommodate every house having an EV let alone two, the wires literally aren‚Äôt big enough for the ampacity draw. On the municipalities side bigger wires means bigger conduits meaning any underground wiring needs to be dug up and reinstalled. On the consumer side you are responsible for the wire from the property into your house. Some estimate the cost to redo the wiring to your house in order to accommodate an EV is roughly $7,500 and that is just for one EV, not two and it is a cost that you will have to pay. It should also be noted that property taxes will also increase as bigger power lines are installed to distribute power throughout ageing municipalities.

**A ‚ÄúGreener‚Äù Future where you have less green in your account.**

**Net Zero.** As countries strive towards reducing their carbon footprint government worldwide are looking for ways to innovate and revolutionize the way we use and consume energy and create pollution. Net zero homes are not a brand new concept but they are becoming built more frequently and along with countries setting standards on minimum ev production rates building standards requiring houses to be net zero are also getting a foothold. A typical net-zero home costs between 10%-30% more than an average, conventional build. Do you own a house? Are you able to afford a house? If you have to pay 10-30% more for your home could you have done it? Or would you have had to sacrifice size or other amenities because of your budget? This move towards net zero building standards is not optional and not a matter of if but a matter of when. This increase in will further fuel a crunch on the average Joe struggling to maintain their quality of life.

**Real Estate.** With rates hitting their highs average Joe is feel pressure but not pain, yet. Unemployment is relatively stable and people can still get jobs, however mass layoffs have been affecting companies and as the claws of the interest rate hikes dig in deeper the layoffs will be more pronounced and people will struggle to pay their mortgages along with high grocery prices. This is because true pain is a lagging indicator, people are struggling to stay afloat but it is manageable for now but how long this sustainable for until something breaks? Are you able to pay your mortgage or rent and groceries and still some money left over to save? Or yolo into something like BBBY?

Within the commercial real estate sector in the USA 1.5 Trillion in loans will be maturing over the next two years. Developers and landlords are calling for more time to restructure and repay debt. All while, the value of their buildings is deceasing. Consider that the bulk of commercial real estate loans were financed when base rates were near zero ‚Äî far below today‚Äôs rates closer to 5%. Not only are the rates higher, but the real estate values are much lower, especially in cities afflicted with high vacancy rates from ongoing work-from-home policies. Prior to the pandemic, 95% of U.S. offices were occupied. Today, that number is closer to 47%. The drop wiped out $453 billion of commercial real-estate value, according to the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). More than 70% of municipal taxes come from property taxes. Without a healthy market, developers will be forced to seek tax-abatement, resulting in lower collections for city budgets, and less resources for public schools, law enforcement, public transportation and other municipal services. A sustained lack of activity in U.S. cities will further diminish the vibrancy of businesses that rely on foot traffic from offices and residents ‚Äî ranging from restaurants, retail stores and more.

House prices are also expected to decline 15% in the back half of 2023. Imagine putting 5% down on a house that is now worth 15% less than what you paid.

**What to do.** ‚ÄúNow, Aesop was not much of a finance major, because he said something like, ‚ÄòA bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.‚Äô But he doesn‚Äôt say when.‚Äù Interest rates‚Äîthe cost of borrowing‚ÄîBuffett explained, are the price of ‚Äúwhen.‚Äù They are to finance as gravity is to physics. As interest rates vary, the value of all financial assets‚Äîhouses, stocks, bonds‚Äîchanges, as if the price of birds had fluctuated. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs why sometimes a bird in the hand is better than two birds in the bush and sometimes two in the bush are better than one in the hand. ‚ÄùIn his flat, breathy twang, the words coming so fast that they sometimes ran over one another, Buffett related Aesop to the great bull market of the 1990s, which he described as baloney. Profits had grown much less than in that previous period, but birds in the bush were expensive because interest rates were low. Fewer people wanted cash‚Äîthe bird in the hand‚Äîat such low rates. So investors were paying unheard-of prices for those birds in the bush. Casually, Buffett referred to this as the ‚Äúgreed factor.‚Äù -The Snowball -Alice Shroeder/Warren Buffet.

The Fed has been aggressively hiking rates into an inverted yield curve, this is not good, in fact this is the most inverted yield curve since 1981. A recession is coming. The only question now is will the recession be mild or severe. A lot of that will depend on the duration and the extent in the contraction in credit that lies around the bend. The Fed implicitly is calling for a recession. A soft landing that follows the Fed tightening cycle has happened 20% of the time. But at those times the Fed was not tightening into an inverted yield curve. The futures market is pricing in two rate cuts in the second half of the year. I think the Fed will be cutting rates a lot more. Everything moves in cycles. We know that in recessions, whether severe or mild, the Fed historically cuts the funds rate by 500 basis points. They‚Äôre not going to signal that right now, with unemployment at 3.5% and inflation at 6%, but that is the historical record.

At a minimum, they‚Äôre going to have to take the funds rate down to 2.5%. They‚Äôre going to have to cut rates a lot, because the one thing that hasn‚Äôt changed in this cycle is the Fed‚Äôs own view of where the neutral fed funds rate is, and that is 2.5%. Getting to 2.5% is only eliminating the excess tightening that they‚Äôve put into the system in the past year. A lot of people don‚Äôt realize the extent of the tightening in monetary policy. The current funds rate is double the Fed‚Äôs own estimate of neutral. Which is why the yield curve is inverted as it‚Äôs been, and the money supply is contracting at an unprecedented 2.5% annual rate.

Right now interest rates are high, as of now, any cash that would be eaten away by inflation already has been. Holding cash and collecting interest is a wise choice as we wait for value to be found in the market. As we move into a recession (however deep it may be) Gold and other precious metals are also a good choice.

**When**. While it is impossible to accurately time the market it is not impossible to predict what will occur. Market cycles are just that, they are cyclical cycles with a predictable pattern. While the depths of bear markets and the peaks of bulls markets cannot be accurately predicted ahead of time we can say with certainty that they will happen. The closest thing we can do to predicting when is looking into the past

fundamental bear market lows occur only after the Fed has cut interest rates significantly, re-steepened the yield curve, and with the bond market helping re-establish a more appropriate equity risk premium.

Based on historical data, the average time between the S&P 500 peak and the onset of recession is about 6 1/2 And it takes an average of 12 1/2 months for the S&P 500 to go from peak to trough, which usually happens before a recession ends. (See chart below.)

Average Recession Timeline

What I am watching for is the pause which I assume will happen next month. We should rally until then and I believe we will see renewed optimism after the pause announcement as everyone starts getting bullish again in hopes for rates to come down in the third and fourth quarter of this year. If history is right though we haven‚Äôt felt full economic pain and even in a pause max pain will not be felt its only once the fed realizes it needs to starting cutting rates that we truly feel the full effects of the rate hikes that have taken place. The recession itself, is a lagging indicator. By then It will be too late to sell but a great opportunity to start buying and DCAing in all the way to the floor.

505,Talk me out of buying puts on NFLX tomorrow after horrific earnings 2 quarters in a row! 20% decline in earnings for 3.7% growth,Discussion,"NFLX a ""FANG"" was the first to report of the big tech names. The SP500 has 66 tech stocks that account for 30% of the index. 10 Big Tech companies account for 20% of the SP500. This could be a really bad sign for big tech!

NFLX 4th quarter of 2022 had 1.9% sales growth year over year, 90% earnings decline

NFLX 1st quarter of 2023 had 3.7% sales growth and 20% earnings decline

For reference the SP500 as we know it since 1957 has returned a little over 8% compounded. The average SP500 stock on those years grows sales 10-20% and earnings 5-10%. The SP500 trades historically at 17-18 earnings.

NFLX is clearly priced higher, trading at 40-50x earnings, sales has stalled and earnings is declining. NFLX is on pace to make 8 dollars roughly for the year..

The day before? [MSFT earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12zph3r/your_lotto_play_for_metas_earnings_tonight/), posted it before market close. Those who followed either times made big money! What's today's post? Let's take a look at Amazon (AMZN) which is set to release its earnings report today after the closing bell. Can we do it again? Let's see. We're all eagerly waiting to see the tech giant's financial performance for the first quarter of 2023. With a gain of 23% year to date, way above the 7% rise in the S&P 500 index, Amazon has been one of the better-performing names within the tech sector. We want to know if daddy Bezos can maintain his strong momentum.

I expect the company to top the consensus estimates of earnings and revenues. Amazon outperformed the street expectations in the last quarter, with net revenues increasing by 9% to $149.2 billion. It was due to a 13% rise in North America revenues and a 20% improvement in the Amazon web services segment. That said, the positive impact was partially offset by an 8% drop in international division revenues. I fully expect the Q1 result to be on similar lines.

Trefis estimates Amazon‚Äôs valuation at [$134 per share](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/AMZN/no-login-required/p5DVYQLL/Amazon-AMZN-Valuation-Is-AMZN-Stock-Expensive-Or-Cheap-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis230427), which is 22% above the current market price of around $110. 

**Revenues expected to top the estimates**

[Amazon‚Äôs revenues grew 9% y-o-y](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/AMZN/no-login-required/HcytK2Km/Amazon-Revenues-How-Does-AMZN-Make-Money-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis230427) to $514 billion in FY2022.

* The company witnessed positive growth in net revenues from physical stores (11%), third-party seller services (14%), subscription services (11%), advertising services (21%), and AWS (29%) divisions. We expect the same pattern to continue in Q1.
* The net sales from the online stores category marginally decreased in the year to $220 billion. We expect the same trend to continue in Q1.
* Overall, we forecast Amazon‚Äôs revenues to touch $560 billion for the full-year 2023.

The estimates follow that Amazon‚Äôs fiscal Q1 2023 net revenues to be around $125.99 billion, slightly above the $124.54 billion consensus estimate.

**EPS is likely to beat the consensus estimates**

Amazon Q1 2023 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.22, 5% above the consensus estimate of $0.21. The adjusted net income decreased from $33.4 billion to -$2.7 billion in FY 2022. It was partly due to an increase in operating expenses and partly because of an unfavorable decrease in non-operating income from $13.3 billion to -$18.2 billion. Markedly, the non-operating income primarily suffered because of a pre-tax valuation loss from an equity investment in Rivian Automotive.

We expect the operating expenses to follow the same trend in Q1. Overall, Amazon is likely to report an annual GAAP EPS of $1.71 and revenue per share of $55.44 for the full-year 2023.

**Stock price estimate is 22% higher than the current market price**

Remember the $134 evaluation? This was using an RPS estimate of around $55.44 and a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of just above 2x in fiscal 2023. This translates into a price of $134, which is 31% above the current market price. Note that P/E Multiples are based on Share Price at the end of the year and reported (or expected) Adjusted Earnings for the full year.

**What do other Finance Websites Say?**

[TipRanks](https://www.tipranks.com/) also expects Amazon to post strong results. They report that Amazon's cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is likely to remain a significant contributor to the company's overall revenue.

[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/) predicts that Amazon's first-quarter earnings will be driven by its e-commerce and cloud computing businesses. It also notes that AWS (Amazon Web Services) is expected to post revenue of $14.03 billion, representing a YoY increase of 28.6%. 

[Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/) mentions that in response to an uncertain macro backdrop, management has implemented some aggressive cost-saving measures to boost both profitability and its margin profile. These measures include shutting down unprofitable businesses, reducing its global headcount and reprioritizing resources in an effort to right-size the business. The goal is for amazon (like meta) to emerge leaner and stronger. 

For those who don't know the [Tastylive website](https://www.tastylive.com/), they've also provided a comprehensive preview of Amazon's earnings report, highlighting the company's ability to beat expectations in the past. Amazon has a history of surpassing Wall Street's earnings estimates, and it is expected to continue this trend in Q1 2023. However, they also mention potential challenges, such as supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, that could impact the company's financial performance.

**Amazon Earnings Expected Move**

Take a look at the implied volatility of the options market, we can see what the market perception is on AMZN‚Äôs stock price movement going forward. With an expected move of ¬±$6.55, we are looking at just over a 5% expected move on the current stock price for this earnings announcement, which is not necessarily high for a household name like Amazon. If we were to look further into the June cycle though, we can see that this ¬±$6.55 expected move makes up over 60% of the June cycle‚Äôs expected move, which is a substantial chunk given the circumstances.

AMZN stock is currently trading around $110, and we can see that equidistant out-of-the-money options for the weekly options cycle are trading for around the same price - this tells us that the market is not pricing in any sort of skew for this announcement, which is a perceived high-velocity movement. This basically (unfortunately) offers no indication on whether it's going to move up or down. However, given all the details above, what do *you* think? No seriously, take a moment to think about the information presented before you continue reading and try to think: calls or puts for earnings? We do know that with the stock currently at $110, Amazon's risk-versus-reward profile suggests the stock could produce strong returns in the next 12 to 18 months. *But what about earnings??*

**What to do for today's Earnings**

Given all the considerations above, it would be an absolute degen play to even bother considering going into Amazon for earnings. (Oh.. who am I kidding?( Let's fucking go for it! AMZN 4/28 call spread is looking juicy. Can buy the 115c and sell the 120c for $122. This can offer 4.1x gains if things go our way. Mind you, this is not financial or investment advice - this post is just offering education based on what people tend to look for in a company to make an earnings prediction.

# 0. TLDR

A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. üöÄüí∞üìà.  I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects.  Bill Gates is invested.

# 1. Intro

Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series.  A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting.  I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century.  I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts.  This one is specifically about $ECL.  I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter.  I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit.

I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion).

At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt.  ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say.  So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more.  There are really two different angles here that I will discuss.  The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion.

&#x200B;

[The Trick Is To Let Them Cook](https://preview.redd.it/7bdstuxty8za1.png?width=588&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1d5a780e8093b29400bb0370e67ea97ff139bba4)

# 2. Water and Chips

The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. [Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/new-us-fabs-everything-we-know).

&#x200B;

[It Was There That I Started To Question About Water](https://preview.redd.it/jjd9lxo1z8za1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=634f3decb684e2cd20e3ba996da106988f41f952)

What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries.  Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task.  To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately **2,200** **gallons of water**; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below).  So a¬†large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to **4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day.** T**his equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty).**

wow. numbers man... crazy.  Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is.  If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would.

&#x200B;

[FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool](https://preview.redd.it/0xmsfyz3z8za1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=882f8fffeca837e1d1703d7ca466ebd5fedbd90d)

This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size.  It holds about  660,000¬†US¬†gallons.  Which means, that for a large facility, you would need  7.3 of these fuckers full of water **a day** (copy and paste this image 7.3 times).

In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan,  droughts can bring production to a screeching halt.  Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC.  The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way.  Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and [the Water Wars are already starting](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/27/arizona-scottsdale-water-cut-off-rio-verde-foothills-drought?ref=upstract.com).  I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that.  Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are **not** going to happen I would be grateful.

So, why do they need so much water?  A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water.  But, it's not *just* water. It's Ultra Pure Water.

[Ultra Pure Water (UPW)](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/support/tools-resources/dictionary/purity-on-another-level-ultrapure-water/) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water.  The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB.  No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2.  From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive.

So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain.  There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste.  They recycle it.

This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group [NALCO](https://www.ecolab.com/nalco-water).  Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation.  See where I am going with this?  Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011.  I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at  $38.80 per share.  It has pretty much been forgotten about.

I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now.  Trust me bro.  I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine.  [https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726](https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726).   I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"".   This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet.  The Plants are still being built.

If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona.

The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock.  This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon.  When they do, **I THINK** the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment,  carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up.

The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL.  Bill Gates has done it for you.

Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and [anything / anyone else he can use](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/environment/water-restoration-arizona.html).  It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure.  He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future.  Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some.

>Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice.  With wells already dug and everything. What Luck!  It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants.  Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water.  Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse.  They are used to dump waste water into though.

>The top land per state is:

1. Louisiana
2. Arkansas
3. Arizona
4. Nebraska
5. Washington

>That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"".  I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood.  Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji‚Ñ¢ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA.  Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji!

I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""[global warming](https://twitter.com/goddeketal/status/1655658051855065090?t=0fqTNBwM8Q2B5HNU86b4Aw&s=19) causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on.

The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers.  Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc...  What he wants to do: [Smart City](https://www.facebook.com/worldeconomicforum/videos/10154914651546479/) of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch.  I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part.

# 4. The Stock

At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: [Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/ECL/insider-trades/).  Last Buy was August of 2022.

Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67.  Wish it was cheaper.  If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish.  Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon.  You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48.  Probably for taxes.  Probably...  Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc...  In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss.

This has created the opportunity for buying it cheap. Resistance at $221 according to the chart.  There is your sell.

Here is there 2022 financial statement.  Go ahead and look through it and read every page like I did (jk).

I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends.   Something interesting and bearish that I found is they are [being sued by a bankrupt company](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/chemical-maker-tpc-group-reaches-30-million-bankruptcy-settlement-2022-10-27/).  NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit.

Sales increased, of course.  Growing demand for water control/automation and  [squeezing out every](https://savethewater.org/bill-gates-omniprocessor-future-water-technology/) [drop at](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-30709273) peak performance will be rocketing in demand as water transitions from an abundant resource to a precious commodity in the next decade.

# 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation

The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation.  Their bread and butter.  Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them.  Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts.  Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends.  Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this.

As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions.  There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further.

Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc.  The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap.  After that it's free game.  However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs.

Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds.  There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment.  It's all about the control and efficacy of water.

Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country.

&#x200B;

[The Carpet is Ohio](https://preview.redd.it/v1wpsj2jz8za1.png?width=456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=048c43d0ebf93b9217bbe20a238279c76773fdb5)

Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. [Holy Shit](https://preventchemicaldisasters.org/chemical-facility-incidents/).  Just like Bill Gates had an investment in [vaccines](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/23/bill-gates-turns-10-billion-into-200-billion-worth-of-economic-benefit.html) pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?!  The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a  campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue.

Here is where I would post the tldr, but instead I will have to post a thanks for reading the whole thing.

As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer.  To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control.  The play is pretty much as far out as you want it to be.  by the time the stock reaches back up to 222 per share, it'll be a totally different company with the thirstiest industry relying on them and building a smart cities infrastructure.

My positions: relatively small now as I swing traded it, but the xx shares I've kept have a low cost basis and I will be adding to this big before the next earnings report and getting calls  in a few months.

The are are two basic reasons: 1) Silver is a an insurance policy. Going back millennia, people who feel unsure about their futures, have hoarded it. Governments need people to spend their money in the open economy to make it function, not tie it up in physical metal. 

Had people bought physical silver during CoVid-19 with the stimmies the Fed printed out -BRRRRRRR, (more Dollars during that year or so than the total prevously issued in the entire history of the Federal Reserve Bank), the US economy would have been BF'd. So, the Treasury and SEC, the CFTC, the LBMA, Comex and the bullion banks colluded the fix the silver price beneath $25 using high frequency futures trading on the COMEX, carried out by JP Morgan. They were eventually prosecuted for it and fined $920m, but it continues. Here's a link to a great article that explains it all;

If you have been around trading for any amount of time you know that historically speaking we end up with articles saying to sell in May and buy back in October. What I find hilarious if you type in ‚Äústocks sell in may‚Äù to google right now these are the first two article that pop up‚Ä¶ The Media has a way of not only keeping us on our toes and they also have a way of shaping the narrative to fit their needs. 

**Bank Crisis** 

If this feels like d√©j√† vu to you well it should‚Ä¶ why? Because guess when the last bank collapse happened? It happened the week before FOMC (relatively speaking)‚Ä¶ And now the quiet week right before FOMC what do we have? We have FRC officially going under‚Ä¶ Officially as of EOD here we are with FRC being taken over by the government and going into receivership. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sb5r4k212qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bbbd85dc645eb5f7f4352acbdd49980cae0ba646

If you traded today then you saw the massive market drop we had from 1030 until 11am‚Ä¶ At that point you would have thought it was over for the bulls and that market much like in March with the SVB issues would see a huge drop and that would be it for the bulls‚Ä¶ 

However, we regained strength and some how managed to continue to push up EOD. This further fits not my theory I mentioned last night that I truly believe this is a run for the exit and retail is being left as the exit liquidity. 

I have two questions‚Ä¶ whos next (bank wise)? And how does this effect FOMC next week? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fjnvcxq12qwa1.png?width=966&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=57eb264aa37d0e76df84491e278efac1a69b9215

So now JPOW is in a REALLY tough place here‚Ä¶ why? Well he has to now answer for how SVB and FRC are both outliers and there contagion hasn‚Äôt truly set in now‚Ä¶ The next question is that last FOMC jpow DID consider a pause but they still went ahead and got did a 25bps rate hike‚Ä¶ 

JPOW also mentioned that rate hikes is still his base case‚Ä¶ meaning he expects to continue to hike and definitely is not planning to pause‚Ä¶

FOMC Wednesday is likely to be very spicy‚Ä¶ 

**FOMC**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1ie86w522qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d9fba64e599491ea385ea89e66369d99cc56826f

Now unless you have been living under a rock‚Ä¶ you know that FOMC is next Wednesday May 3rd. Now we also have ADP non farm, and PMI‚Ä¶ So lets talk about it‚Ä¶ whats the expectation for FOMC on Wednesday? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gkh2t5i22qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0781278e3e0e36698389ed017ad133a33739e7c7

This week saw a peak expectation of at 89.1% chance of a 25bps on Wednesday‚Ä¶ however, today with seemingly the news from FRC we saw that number drop down to 80.@ as of EOD. 

For me I am fairly confident JPOW is going to do a 25bps rate hike and I am also fairly confident that despite what happens over the weekend with FRC we are going to see him stick to the script that inflation is still too hot and has not properly come down yet, he is also going to once again re-iterate that rate cuts is NOT the base case and that the fed does NOT expect a pause by EOY. 

The question we are faced with this time‚Ä¶ will the markets believe him or not? 

There absolutely is a base case where the market shrugs him off once again and pushes this higher until we get a true CPI rebound (possibly the following week) that then ‚Äúshocks‚Äù the market. However, IF we finally see market and price this in correctly for the first time since March we might finally see not only a sell off but a sustained sell off in the markets. 

**Calendar of Events**

&#x200B;

From a calendar of events stand point we have a banger of week ahead data wise‚Ä¶ 

Monday starts us off with more PMI data, followed by Tuesday with JOLTS, then of course Wednesday is ADP, more PMI and FOMC, we immediately follow up the fireworks on Wednesday with challenger jobs, and unemployment claims, then we finish the week out with the all important unemployment rate and our first fed speaker Cook post FOMC. 

Pre Markets next week are likely to be extremely volatile and unpredictable. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/av11ere32qwa1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=05fda32e6a3911b5700d95f9054c9823de79ec4c

Alright lets get into the technical now. 

After establishing a new demand (support) yesterday at 404.3 I was wondering if we might see a push up to 414.22 to take out that demand before starting our next leg down. I did not expect us to push through that and break through 415.25 supply. We had a pretty large fight at 415.25 most of the day and for a lot of the day until the huge EOD push up it looked like that was our line in the sand. 

However, we have now found ourselves wondering if we are going to push higher through 417.03 supply or if we found ourselves back in the daily range. If we do push higher here we have a huge gap from 417.03 to 429.8 with no major levels in between. 

**SPY Weekly SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ve5mmwt32qwa1.png?width=866&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0b4c5beecb0fccfbfaa225dfabf05998dd716c97

This is where things get a little interesting here and honestly the more I look at it the more the weekly looks like we might actually have a huge blow off top push to 427.53 before we finally come cratering down. 

Last week we put in a new supply. Doing so allowed us to come down and take out previous 409.98 supply. What is incredible and extremely unexpected is that we actually in the process of all of that turned weekly supply at 412.66 into a weekly demand now at 411.87. 

It should definitely be noted this is what I would call a ‚Äúweak‚Äù demand (support), however, it is definitely not something we can ignore. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ntl1nvb42qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=00f8916e19fd456bf0a9d1795d3666be0f5cb297

Now what really is impressive here is how fast this recovered this week. Two days ago I wouldn‚Äôt have expected to close over 405.2 let alone all the way back over 415‚Ä¶ 

As you can see we actually do find ourselves in a broad black bull channel once again and we have ourselves in a 3 day long intense red bull channel. 

When we loss 405.2 I would have expected a continuation back down to 390.1, however, we actually found ourselves bouncing aggressively off the daily 50ema and retaking the daily 8/20ema. 

**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fqspads42qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=821780086cb34f55ab7ef0dcd2bbfcc6753672da

Looking at the weekly price action objectively here we after closing three doji candles in a row we actually just closed out a massive bearish hanging man candle‚Ä¶ 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lskbyl852qwa1.png?width=949&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e4ce1621050eceb24c329a7d405a025d5ad596e8

Now as you can see one could assume that this IS the top‚Ä¶ however, that would mean that we are trading based on sound technicals and logic. Or perhaps this is a preamble to whats going to happen after FOMC. However, we definitely have to take in to consideration the fact that we did drop and bounce off the weekly 20/50ema‚Ä¶ 

Honestly as much as I am bearish long term‚Ä¶ it is very hard not to feel bullish looking at this here. So lets talk about it‚Ä¶

From a bullish stand point today we bounced off the daily 8ema and confirmed it as support today. Since we bounced back inside the 405.2 to 419.5 channel the natural upside target here should be 419.5. not only that we did close over the march 18th 415.6 candle high just barely‚Ä¶ but in doing so we should open ourselves up for more upside. 

From a bearish stand point we are coming into the upper end of our range here and resistance where bears have their highest opportunity and chance to reject. The one thing I have noticed lately on SPY is that we go on these sell offs that then lead into massive 2 days rallies that make absolutely no sense form a technical stand point‚Ä¶ the most recent example is March 15th/ 16th and March 2nd and 3rd.

Now the question is which case is stronger here‚Ä¶ from a macro economical/ data stand point we should see our top here and we should start our next leg down‚Ä¶ however, from a daily technical stand point here as long as we hold this daily 8ema honestly its very hard for me to not want to feel bullish and start looking for a rally to 420+ into FOMC. 

SPY Weekly Levels  
 Supply- 427.5  
 Demand- 411.9  
 Support- 411.6 -> 407.3 -> 404.2  
 Resistance- 416.1 -> 422

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/whbp74u52qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5aea334263ba01f965a43e8a3c9db58d138f20d3

Now on futures daily supply and demand here there is no change on futures‚Ä¶ we bounced off 4085 demand and established that two days ago and now we are attempting to push through 4178 and follow through 4198 supply. 

If we can break through 4198 supply then much like SPY we have a pretty large push up to 4310 without much levels in between. 

One thing to point out here on futures daily is the volatility (relatively speaking using an indicator) we have put in back to back high volatility bars. Now the last time we did this (put in a high volatility bar let alone more then one) was March 10th to March 20th‚Ä¶. We actually put 7 high volatility bars in a row in‚Ä¶ and what happened then? Well you guess it‚Ä¶ we put the bottom of the sell off in and then went on a month plus long rally. 

So the theory would be here with this high volatility that we are nearing the top and we should be nearing the temporary top.

Now this is where we actually find ourselves in a much different place on Futures then we do on SPY‚Ä¶. Futures did not establish a new demand and it also did not come down low enough to 4055 to take out previous weekly supply. 

However, this is where we have found ourselves in a massive weekly imbalance‚Ä¶ we are seeing ourselves establishing a weekly demand and then immediately turning around to close over that weekly supply‚Ä¶ that show an incredible imbalance that will need to be reconciled by either a massive flush back under this 4173 supply or a large enough push up towards that 4283 supply that we can turn 4173 into a demand (much like spy did).

Now on a daily stand point here for Futures we find ourselves in a place much like SPY‚Ä¶ a massively broad 2 month long black bull channel followed by a huge extreme red bull channel. 

The question would be are we on a path up to that 4250- 4300 area or have we found ourselves actually finding the top? I hate that we are truly each day left with more questions than answers‚Ä¶

Futures did not quite break through the wick tops of the January/ February highs, however, we also closed out a massive hanging man bearish reversal weekly candle here too‚Ä¶ This one was however, bullish engulfing‚Ä¶ 

Again far more questions than true answers and sense of direction‚Ä¶ I truly hope that FOMC provides not only direction but sense of answers and clarity. 

Futures Weekly Levels  
 Supply- 4174 -> 4284  
 Demand-3919  
 Support- 4149 -> 4095

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/opo4rrt72qwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=38bc377e57d86398d3b0d8f19e415b0fba8c58da

The one question I think we ask ourselves every single day‚Ä¶ IS the VIX broken? My answer is yes but only when it wants to be‚Ä¶

So lets pain the picture here‚Ä¶ This week (and today) we got data that suggested inflation has not cooled, we got data that suggested a recession is upon us, we got data that suggested the economy remains far too strong (remember strong economy the harder and longer JPOW can rate hike), not only that we witness yet another bank (this time the 14th largest) officially go under, and we have one of the most important fed events in less than three trading days (FOMC). 

Now despite all of this‚Ä¶ the VIX (which remembers shows you the voaltility of longer 28+ dte options) decided it was going to not only put in a 52 week low but an almost 18 month LOW for the VIX‚Ä¶ 

From low to high over the last 3 days the VIX has unwound nearly 20%. Absolutely insane when you look at what is coming up over the next two weeks and not only that everything we got data wise this week.

Truly I just can not for the life of me fathom why the VIX is behaving like this and I truly can not really imagine a world where no one feels the need to put on long term downside protection‚Ä¶ 

I mean look at that massive spike in March with the last time we got the same banking information‚Ä¶ why are we not seeing a similair reaction?

Todays trading started out much like yesterday but honestly it was even more extreme during opening hour‚Ä¶ I truly cant remember the last time we ran $3 up during opening hour let alone during the first 30 minutes of the day. 

Thankfully I was able to make some money on some scalps and then it pretty much all went down hill from there‚Ä¶ we had that huge reaction to the FRC data and that‚Äôs where everything went wonky‚Ä¶ market couldn‚Äôt decide if we were going to melt down like march or if we were going to ATH‚Ä¶ after getting absolutely massacred I was able to crawl back to some decent profits to close out the day. 

I think what is most frustrating over the last two weeks is that I have had incredibly profitable Monday, Tuesday and Wednesdays and then end up unfortunately giving back some of it on Thursdays and Fridays. 

One interesting trend that I am monitoring on my weekly logs is that for 2023 my win rate has dropped almost 20-30% since January, however, despite a rough February my profitability remains the same. The question would be why? One thing that I have noticed lately over the last 2-3 weeks is that I am allowing myself to take far more entries then every before (or perhaps im just getting more entries). I have noticed that if the entry criteria is there then I take the play‚Ä¶ however, sometimes that obviously doesn‚Äôt play out. One thing I have also noticed is that I am far quicker to stop myself out then ever before. All in all a good week of trading and profits though.

589,Third time is a charm? Nearing the End - long post,Discussion," I haven't posted here in awhile mostly because I havent had much to say. But I think the next couple of weeks will be interesting. I hate people who waffle so here's what I am saying in case you don't want to read the long post: the VIX is going higher and the market is going lower and there is already evidence the house of cards is teetering.

I am not going to discuss the terrible breadth in the market, or what the VIX is actually signaling the market will do in the next couple of months (move in a 1% range), or the fact that we are being invaded at our southern border, or that the market returns are largely due to five stocks, or that CMG has a PE of 55, Salesforce 961 PE, Zoom 187, NVDA 162, or that earnings were terrible if you remove cost cutting measures etc. None of that matters either apparently.

# When will this tight range end?

Way back in February, I posted somewhat jokingly that what would drive everyone nuts is if the SP500 pinned itself to the 4000 level. Here we are in June and thats effectively what its done. I've posted about my frustration, my bewilderment and then my conviction that when it does break, it will be to the downside.

Whats important is not to take one or two data points and then deduct a result that is full of confirmation bias. However, I believe we are close - like next two weeks close - to this market being able to break out of this range.

A couple of points (thanks again to my expat genius on Twitter @/frankoz95967943 who learned me the very complex details of this) - all of these I have discussed at length in posts on my sub):

1. VIX is being suppressed artificially. I have covered how in previous posts. Simplest way to know is to look at HYG. It normally correlates. Not anymore.
2. Oil is also being suppressed. Again, if oil rises, everything else rises in price. The Fed does not want inflation. Best way to fight inflation is to keep oil down. I've shared how they are doing this in previous posts. (links at the end)
3. The Japanese are the major fbuddy helping the Fed do all of this.

I have to tell you that in +30 years in the market managing assets, I have not seen a market like this before. It is unnatural and controlled. That's why the VIX keeps dropping when risk keeps rising. I have posted at great length about the outlier risks that currently exist (Ukraine, banks, etc.) so no need to get into that again.

# WHY IS IT DIFFERENT NOW?

So a couple of things have happened and a couple are scheduled to happen that have caused me to go out on a limb and say this: what the Fed can control is limited and the end is near. Yes, the Fed can print money ad infinitum, like they have been doing, and the Japanese can play their role, but at some point, outside events will occur that they cannot control. Even with the help of the devil, I mean Jamie Dimon and JPM.

Here is what has happened recently:

# TRIGGER #1: OIL being manipulated is close to being out of US hands:

1. As I postulated earlier, because the US keeps hammering down the price of oil, eventually those countries whose GDP is based on oil might decide they've had enough. Well, OPEC+ is communicating they've had enough.
   1. [Saudi Minister Says OPEC+ Could Cut Production At Any Time | OilPrice.com](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Saudi-Minister-Says-OPEC-Could-Cut-Production-At-Any-Time.html)
2. Then there is this: [Iraq And Iran Ignore U.S. Sanctions In Talks To Expand Energy Ties | OilPrice.com](https://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/Middle-East/Iraq-And-Iran-Ignore-US-Sanctions-In-Talks-To-Expand-Energy-Ties.html)
3. There this: [Syria‚Äôs normalization signals a new Middle Eastern order (brookings.edu)](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2023/05/10/syrias-normalization-signals-a-new-middle-eastern-order/) <----- Let's not forget that Assad is a war criminal. So bad that the Arab league suspended Syria's membership in 2011.
   1. Of course, the NeoCons in the US govt respond by doing this: [US lawmakers introduce bill to combat normalization with Syria's Assad (yahoo.com)](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-combat-135934548.html)

The Middle East seems to be getting MORE peaceful, not less, Israel excluded of course. Why? I think its because they see that they have a shot at gaining more control over their regional politics AND perhaps a chance to wean themselves off of the US dollar dependance.

If the price of oil is allowed to trade freely, its going up. Period. If the price of oil goes up, inflation goes up.

# RESULT: If oil goes up, inflation goes up, and then the Fed will truly lose control.

# TRIGGER #2: DEBT CEILING TALKS

Lots of news lately about the debt ceiling. Of course the debt ceiling would not be a problem if the US just spent LESS but thats a moot point since thats not going to happen. I don't know if the US will default, probably not a full default anyway. BUT, the mere appearance of the possibility of the US defaulting will cause risk assets to plummet.

1. [Biden and Hill leaders postpone debt meeting as deal talks continue - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/11/debt-limit-meeting-between-biden-and-hill-leaders-postponed-00096548)
2. [McCarthy was 'disrespectful' in Biden meeting on debt limit, sources say (nbcnews.com)](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/mccarthy-was-disrespectful-in-biden-meeting-on-debt-limit-sources-say-173870149509) \- what a bunch of children.
3. [McCarthy blasts Biden after White House debt ceiling meeting (axios.com)](https://www.axios.com/2023/05/09/mccarthy-biden-white-house-debt-ceiling-meeting)

Look, they will raise the debt ceiling at some point. The question is how long it will take and who will blink first. However, the longer it takes, the more nervous the markets become.

Don't forget this too: ***The Treasury General Account fell to $154 billion, down from $184 billion on May 9th. In fact, at this rate, the account will be EMPTY on May 19th. OPEX.***

Don't be fooled by the chatter of deals and more deals. Yes, a deal will get done but the point is the SP500 is not trading like there is any concern.

# RESULT: The empty TGA will force the US government to RAISE rates it offers to investors to fund operations. Raising rates is bad for the market.

# TRIGGER #3: SHORT SELLING BAN on bank stocks.

Beyond the hypocrisy of this, compounded by the fact that other than Yellen, the main spokesperson trumpeting this idea is the devil, I mean Jamie Dimon, is the fact that the last time they did this in 2008 after Lehman, 3 months later the XLF was down 51%.

1. [JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon wants US regulators to consider a ban on the short selling of bank stocks | Business Insider India](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-wants-us-regulators-to-consider-a-ban-on-the-short-selling-of-bank-stocks/articleshow/100169845.cms)
2. [Calls to Investigate Short Sellers Intensify as Bank Crisis Deepens - The New York Times (nytimes.com)](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/12/business/dealbook/jamie-dimon-short-sellers-banks.html) <---short sellers as being blamed for bank failures - thats rich.
3. Oddly the SEC says nope.
4. TREASURY SECRETARY YELLEN TO MEET TOP BANK CEOS NEXT WEEK IN WASHINGTON: POLITICO <---- prob to discuss the $18b they are going to force on the banks to recapitalize the bank insurance fund.
5. Discussions of raising the FDIC limit to infinity <--- this is bank nationalization or rather, JPM et al.

# RESULT: A BAN WILL ONLY OCCUR IF ANOTHER BANK IS ABOUT TO FAIL - this is the only reason. IF IT OCCURS, BYE BYE MARKET.

# TRIGGER #4: MONEY IS LEAVING AAPL.

AAPL is close to an all time high. As AAPL goes so goes the market. AAPL's earnings S U C K E D unless you are a fan of gains due to outsourcing of labor overseas. Also, Foxconn, AAPL's largest supplier, reported a 56% drop in net income ( [Apple supplier Foxconn's Q1 profit plunges, outlook ""conservative"" | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-supplier-foxconns-q1-profit-falls-56-yy-worse-than-forecasts-2023-05-11/) ). Oh and Samsung Electronics profit fell 95% in first quarter. But yeah, AAPL is fine.

But while the stock is going up, money is leaving:

1. 2 billion left the stock May 5
   1. Money flowed in May 10th
2. Then this past Friday, 7 billion - and no its not repositioning or some other reason.

***Since Jan 1, AAPL has added $760,000,000,000 in market cap. Sure, that makes sense.***

# RESULT: AAPL rolling over will pull the techs and the rest of the market down.

# All it will take is FOR ONE OF THE ABOVE THINGS TO HAPPEN and the market goes down.

# But wait, thats not all. Here are some possible ""canaries in the coal mine"":

# The VVIX, which is the volatility of the VIX, is going UP when the VIX is being manipulated going down. HUH?

1. The UAE announced a $10 billion short position on US stocks last week. What's odd is how public this announcement was.
   1. I believe this was another warning to Washington to knock off their manipulation of the oil markets.
   2. Our government responded 2 days later that they would start buying to refill the markets in June. What?? Why would you communicate when you will buy in the open markets? The US has publicly stated they will only buy when oil is $67-$72 per barrel. Either the US thinks thats where oil will be or they are communicating to OPEC+ (the + is for Russia) that they will be done screwing around in June.

# OTHER RISK BEING IGNORED:

1. US Banks - not any better regardless of what Yellen and JP and the devil say. There is a structural problem with regional banks: they cannot compete unless they take on more risk and that has led to them taking on more risk which is why the banking system is set to collapse - collapse into a national banking system, run by the devil of course. I am not a conspiracy theorist - if you understand how much money the TBTF banks are getting for less than 1% from the Fed, you understand that regionals dont have a chance.
2. Ukraine - there is still a war going on. People are dying. The US public is done caring about Ukraine having moved on to better things.
3. China / Taiwan - probably not this summer since Taiwan is going to be having an election in 2024 and if the KMT party wins, unification, i mean war is called off: China wins, without a single shot being fired. By the way, this is the great idea our leaders Washington have if China invades: [US Threatens To 'Blow Up' Taiwan's Semiconductor Manufacturing Firm If China Invades The Island; Taipei Unhappy (eurasiantimes.com)](https://eurasiantimes.com/us-threatens-to-blow-up-taiwans-semiconductor-manufacturing/) WHEN YOU HAVE FRIENDS LIKE US...
4. Commercial real estate market is already crashing but of course, nothing to be concerned about

   4. Trucking rates are WORSE than the 2019 ""Trucking Bloodbath"" when 10 large trucking companies went bk. Truck rates are down to $1.19/mile with operating costs up $.30 mile since then. This doesnt even include rising finance costs. (thanks to Craig Fuller@freightalley on Twitter).
5. Other items of interest are credit card chargeoffs higher than 2008 levels, rising auto loan delinquencies, poor tax collections, layoffs, BBBY bankruptcy (this would've normally crashed the market for a day or so due to their large real estate holdings). But yeah, there's no inflation.

# And really, the big data point to me that proves without a doubt the VIX is being manipulated is the following chart which shows that normally, like the last 15 years, when yields move higher, the VIX moves higher (historical R [correlation] of 71.21%). But not this time I guess. VIX is purple, Yields are green.

https://preview.redd.it/tipkjui2zpza1.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=127eacdf3d0ec7b58beb36f345b85022d3a184b0

# CONCLUSION:All it will take is for one card to fall in this humongous house of cards. And I only listed a couple of them.

The US stock market is apparently not concerned. Since the VIX is sub 17 and headed to 0.

The FED is controlling what it can. They are running out of time and money.

The next two weeks are crucial and I have little confidence in Washington <--- they will screw up enough where they can't hide it.

# KEY EVENTS:

* OPEX this Friday
* TGA runs out of money - probably this Friday
* Debt ceiling talks get ulgier - already happening.

***Watch for these for a blow off top:***

1. ***Celebration over universal*** *~~healthcare~~* ***FDIC insurance.***
2. ***AAPL sets a new ATH***
3. ***VIX collapses below 14***

**Disclosure**: I am LONG VIX calls from June to October. Heavy. Like 50%. In my 30 years, buying low VIX was a trade I NEVER lost money on. I trade options, daytrade ES and teach FOR FREE others how to trade (live trading on Friday). I am paying it forward.

601,Why the FDIC Seizure of First Republic Bank Could Cause More Bank Failures,Discussion,"Ok logically it makes little sense for the FDIC to seize a bank for deposit flight since it is the deposits that they are insuring.  100 billion in deposits leaving the bank LOWERS the risk to the insurance fund.

Secondly, most of the potential bidders for the bank were just involved in the effort to help them increase their deposits and those deposits were uninsured so again didn't represent a risk to the insurance fund.

Approximately 70 billion in insured deposits remained secured by 240 billion in assets almost all if which could be liquidated.  

JPM was allowed to buy the bank in violation of the law in a rushed manner with no immediate risks to the insurance fund.  Plus on top of it the insurance fund took an 18 billion dollar hit and allowed a large creditor to pick and choose what assets they would like to keep.

Their book of loans had a .06 default rate.  6/100ths of 1 percent!  Essentially the FDIC handed JPM billions of dollars for free.

There should be lawsuits and an investigation here.  But the biggest issue is that if FDIC is going to act arbitrarily and gift billions of dollars in assets to large banks, no bank is safe from arbitrary takeover.  

JPM wanted those assets and the government let them essentially steal them.

Also how exactly is this deposit flight new information to the FDIC? The entire purpose of the FED borrowing facility was for FRC to be able to borrow against their assets so that they wouldn't have to sell them.  The FED offered that option in RESPONSE TO DEPOSIT FLIGHT at all regional banks. So FRC uses the discount window provided by one part of the government then gets seized by another part.  FDIC was monitoring the situation the entire time.  So they were aware down to the dollar exactly how much FRC had in deposits a month ago when deposit flight started to stabilize.  They had 46 billion in cash.  

So if having 70 billion dollars in insured deposits allows the government to seize 240 billion dollars in assets isn't the real risk being FDIC insured if I am a shareholder in a bank?  Could FDIC seize a bank if it has 1 billion in insured deposits and 100 billion in assets?  Does the FDIC employ accounting firms?  How is taking an 18 billion dollar loss to protect 70 billion in insured deposits the lowest risk to the insurance fund when the bank has 240 billion in Treasury bonds and other liquid assets?  It's absurd.",2023-05-01 12:52:54,173,No one wants these banks to dump 100+ billions of bonds which are at loss currently in open market. That will cause rates to sky rocket üöÄ

607,Guys! ABNB Earnings are Today! How are we gonna get a 5-bagger?,DD,"It's finally time. Airbnb (ABNB) is scheduled to report their earning results today after hours. As you guys know, the company connects hosts and guests online and allows them to book travel services and accommodation facilities worldwide. For the first quarter, Airbnb expects revenues between $1.75 billion and $1.82 billion, implying year-over-year growth in the band of 16-21% on a reported basis and 18-23% on an FX neutral basis. This is most likely driven by growth in European travel and a gradual recovery in China.

To keep things simple, I'm going to put the entire post in jot note form and then provide my conclusion at the end.

**What to Consider**

* Airbnb has been witnessing steady improvements in long-distance and cross-border travel due to relaxed travel restrictions. This is likely to have continued to aid its performance in the first quarter.

* Growing momentum among travelers is likely to have continued driving the [Nights and Experiences Booked](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1193532/airbnb-nights-experiences-booked-worldwide) and Average Daily Rates in the to-be-reported quarter.

* Strengthening demand in North America, EMEA and Latin America is likely to have driven ABNB‚Äôs performance in the quarter under discussion.

* Increasing guest demand for non-urban nights is expected to have continued driving active listings for non-urban destinations in the quarter under review.

* Airbnb‚Äôs consistent efforts to enhance various aspects of its services to gain momentum among its hosts and guests are likely to have benefited the quarterly performance.

* Analyst [Sachin Mittal](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/sachin-mittal) maintained a Buy rating on ABNB stock with a price target of $153

* [Cost cutting measures](https://www.tipranks.com/news/airbnb-nasdaqabnb-trims-headcount-slightly-despite-hiring-plans) taken earlier will reflect higher margins in this quarter.

* However, uncertainties related to the coronavirus pandemic are expected to have been concerning in the first quarter.

* The impacts of macroeconomic headwinds, including rising prices and geo-political tensions, are likely to get reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.

* Intense competition in the online travel market is anticipated to have been an overhang in the to-be-reported quarter.

**Concluding Thoughts**

In the end, we have a booming travel industry that's ripping back and above pre-pandemic levels. Airbnb's are *still* cheaper than hotels. The number of users are growing and the platform has been consistently rolling out new features. I'm gonna literally jump in on calls. Last earnings, we saw the stock rise up +14%. Can it do this again? Doubtful. But what the hell, time for a call spread. I'm buying the 5/12 135c for $241 and selling the 140c for $132. This means the spread can be bought for only 109 bucks, and can offer 4.6x gains *if* the stock goes up 9.6%. Historically, the average move (either up or down) has been about this much. But bare in mind, as with all my other posts, these are entirely meant to just educate people about what we tend to look for when making an earning prediction. It by no means can be considered financial or investment advice.

U.S. officials are assessing the possibility of ""market manipulation"" in  banking share prices, as the White House pledges to monitor  short-selling pressures. Short sellers raked in $378.9 million in paper  profits on Thursday from betting against certain regional banks,  according to analytics firm Ortex. This has drawn increased scrutiny by  federal and state officials and regulators due to strong fundamentals in  the sector and sufficient capital levels. White House press secretary  Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration is closely monitoring  the situation. The S&P 600 bank index dropped over 3% on Thursday,  with PacWest Bancorp shares tumbled over 50% and Western Alliance  Bancorp shares plummeted more than 38%. The increased short-selling  activity has triggered some calls for a temporary ban, but the SEC is  not currently contemplating such a move.

618,My lotto play for DIS's earnings tonight,DD,"Disney is reporting it's fiscal second quarter earnings after the bell. I'm wondering if the media conglomerate can keep regaining its mojo with Disney shares up +13% year to date to top the S&P 500‚Äôs +8%.

Here are what analysts expect:

* Earnings per share: 93 cents per share expected, according to a [Refinitiv](https://www.refinitiv.com/) survey of analysts

* Revenue: $21.79 billion expected, according to Refinitiv

* Disney+ total subscriptions: 163.17 million expected, according to [StreetAccount](https://www.streetaccount.com/)

They're expecting a drop in Disney‚Äôs second-quarter earnings per share compared to the Q2 2022 EPS, but with Q2 sales up from the prior-year quarter. Investors will be hoping that Disney can post another better-than-expected quarter on its bottom line and show a consistent illustration that the company is working in the right direction to elevate its profitability margin despite what is still a challenging macroeconomic environment for most companies. 

Notably, Disney easily surpassed its Q1 EPS expectations by 43% last quarter. The earnings beat was driven by a 21% YoY increase in the Parks, Experiences, and Products segment revenue at $8.7 billion. This led to shares of DIS spiking more than 5% before cooling down and drifting lower in the following weeks. Certainly, more sustainability in Disney‚Äôs price movement after reporting its Q2 results is at focus in hopes that this year‚Äôs rally can be extended.

Beyond day-to-day operations at the company, we're going to expect Bob Iger (CEO of Disney) to address a number ongoing challenges. On Monday, Disney expanded its [federal lawsuit](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/26/disney-sues-florida-gov-ron-desantis-alleges-political-effort-to-hurt-its-business.html) against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, accusing the Republican leader of doubling down on his ‚Äú[retribution campaign](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/08/disney-lawsuit-against-desantis-expanded.html)‚Äù against the company by [signing legislation](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/05/desantis-signs-bill-to-void-disney-development-deals.html) to void Disney‚Äôs development deals in Orlando.

Additionally, the company is already [seeing rippling effects from the ongoing writers strike](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/08/hollywood-writers-strike-halts-stranger-things-severance-production.html), including the production shutdowns of Marvel Studios‚Äô ‚ÄúBlade,‚Äù which was set to begin filming in Atlanta next month, as well as the Disney+ Star Wars series ‚ÄúAndor.‚Äù

**IGER & Cost Cutting**

In regard to Disney increasing its margins, Iger returned to the helm of the company last November with the initiative to reduce expenses and sustain growth and profitability.

During its last quarterly report and Iger‚Äôs first back as CEO, the Disney boss announced the company would cut thousands of jobs and reduce its capital expenditures by $5.5 billion. To the delight of investors, Iger stated the cost-cutting initiatives will make it possible for Disney‚Äôs board to approve the reinstatement of its dividend by the end of the year. We expect a third wave of layoffs within the company announced soon.

**Streaming Growth**

Like streaming competitor Netflix (NFLX), Disney will no longer provide guidance for subscriber growth. With that being said, Disney‚Äôs ability to add subscribers during the quarter will be at the forefront of its Q2 results.

Specifically, Wall Street is eyeing Disney+ after the streaming service lost 2.4 million subscribers during Q1 amid subscription price hikes and increasing competition from big-name tech stocks like AAPL, and AMZN. This was the firstly quarterly loss since Disney+ was launched in 2019. Still, a wider loss was expected among Disney+ subscribers last quarter with Disney topping estimates by 3%.

Disney+ had 161.8 million paid subscribers during Q1 and 234.7 million total subscribers when including its ESPN+ and Hulu services. While Disney‚Äôs total paid subscribers topped Netflix‚Äôs 232.5 million paying members, the company‚Äôs Direct to Consumer segment reported a -$1.1 billion loss during Q1 up from -$0.5 billion in the prior-year quarter.

Disney stated the increase in operating loss was due to a higher loss at Disney+ and a decrease in results at Hulu although there were improved results at ESPN+. Direct to Consumer revenue did increase by 13% YoY during Q1 to $5.3 billion.  

Improvement in operating costs among the Direct to Consumer segment will make Disney‚Äôs stock much more attractive. Longer-term investors are hoping that Disney‚Äôs growth among streaming services will eventually lead to massive earnings potential for the company.

**Earnings Expected Move**

Looking at the implied volatility of the options market in Disney, we can see the weekly expected move for the rest of the week is ¬±$3.55 - about 3.5% of the stock‚Äôs notional value. This is not too high of an expected move for an equity, but it is about 77% of the expected move through the June options cycle 39 days away from expiration, and over 50% of the expected move in the July options expiration cycle. Based on this information, the market is placing a lot of weight on Wednesday's earnings report, given the high implied volatility in the weekly cycle relative to further-dated cycles.

With DIS stock trading at $100.70 (at the time of writing this), we can go to equidistant out-of-the-money (OTM) strikes to see if there is a difference in premium, or skewed premium. Looking into the option chain, in this case, the calls is trading for a bit more than the puts, both 5 points OTM from the current stock price. This tells us that Disney‚Äôs options market has call skew in the weekly cycle. This indicates that a high velocity move is being priced into the upside ‚Äì this does not mean the stock is going to go up, but the market is pricing in the risk of a high velocity move to the upside just slightly.

**What to do For Disney Earnings?**

I looked through the last 5 years of movements with earnings, the stock moves on average 4 ¬± 3% after the earnings report. With this said, it might not even be worth getting calls or puts because the premium prices are pricing a move that's very very similar to this percentage. However, given everything I've looked at, I want to get puts. DIS 5/12 99p is 2.03. However, I'll be inversing myself because of the WSB Cramer tag and will make big money with a call spread. I can buy the DIS 5/12 102c for $241 and sell the 105c for $140. This means I can grab the spread for $101, and potentially make 3x gains. Because, why not?",2023-05-10 18:19:11,164,"This is the dumbest fucking thing i've ever seen on this sub. God damn, thanks for the hard laugh OP."

Key takeaways:

&#x200B;

>The government-brokered purchases of regional banks have created a vicious cycle in which troubled lenders need to fail -- and get government assistance -- before buyers will step up, industry sources say.  
>  
>""After what happened with First Republic, banks don't want to buy any other bank before the FDIC takes over,"" said Mayra Rodr√≠guez Valladares, a financial risk consultant at MRV Associates who trains bankers and regulators. ""It's cheaper, the stock price goes down and you don't have the natural problems in M&A (mergers and acquisitions) negotiations that may not end in a deal.""

&#x200B;

>The phenomenon is stoking fears the current turmoil will accelerate the concentration of the banking sector in the United States around a handful of institutions, reducing competition for consumers and deepening the risk if a giant bank fails.

&#x200B;

>After these transactions, publicly-traded buyers are now motivated to wait for ailing lenders to collapse so they can get better terms from the FDIC, analysts said. ""For potential acquirers, there is a motivation to wait for a receivership and FDIC assistance,"" Christopher Wolfe, head of North American banks at Fitch Ratings.

&#x200B;

>Volatility in regional bank stocks makes it even more difficult to strike deals. Take Los Angeles-based PacWest Bancorp (PACW.O) - its shares jumped 82% Friday after sinking more than 40% on Thursday over news the company was exploring options to bolster its finances.  
>  
>Market volatility stops bank buyers from pulling together enough money to cover writedowns on struggling assets, which would be triggered by a traditional acquisition, said David Sandler, co-head of financial services investment banking at Piper Sandler Companies (PIPR.N).

&#x200B;

>Another benefit of buying through an FDIC receivership is avoiding the protracted regulatory approval process that other mergers have faced: Canada's Toronto-Dominion Bank Group ([TD.TO](https://TD.TO)) on Thursday called off its $13.4 billion takeover of First Horizon Corp (FHN.N) after spending more than a year trying to secure approval.",2023-05-07 16:38:58,158,Need a temp ban on short selling of banks.

629,"Insider Trading Weekly Update #035: Oracle CEO Sells $470M, Apple CFO Sheds $11.5M | Ackman Snags More $HHC | Insider Trading Recap",DD,"GM WSB -

TL;DR - Relatively large jump in purchases this past week ($9.7M / +460%), though overall buys remain low compared to insider sales ($1.4B / +103%). Insider transaction activity declined from the prior week, with only 190 companies / 277 insiders submitting Form 4 filings.

The buyers were, once again, funds: Ares Management ($4.2M, $FYBR, Telecom Services) and Ackman‚Äôs Pershing Square ($1.3M, $HHC, Real Estate - Diversified). Both appear to be ‚Äúset it and forget it‚Äù bids as their % change in ownership from the transactions were both < 1%.

There were a few CEO purchases pushing 6-figures:

* Scott Myers, Viridian Therapeutics ($VRDN): $101,479
* Thomson Leighton, Akamai Technologies: $100,175
* Steven Brass, Wd 40 Co: $99,927

And today I learned that WD-40 operates as a standalone company.

# Notable sales from insiders:

* Catz Safra, the CEO of Oracle ($ORCL / Software - Infrastructure) sold 63.24% of their common stock stake in a **$181M sale** on April 12th. **Another $288M** in common stock was sold on April 10th.
* Sessa Capital Fund, a 10% owner of Provention Bio ($PRVB / Biotechnology), sold 12.34% of their stake in a $53.2M sale on April 14th
* Sanat Chattopadhyay, an EVP at Merck & Co ($MRK / Drug Manufacturers - General), sold 100% of their stake in a $15.4M sale on April 13th
* Luca Maestri, the CFO of Apple ($AAPL / Consumer Electronics), sold 39.4% of their stake in an $11.5M sale on April 13th
* Todd Simpson, the CFO of Seagen ($SGEN / Biotechnology), sold 41.32% of his stake in an $11.3M sale on April 10th
* Bruce Sachs, a Director at Vertex Pharmaceuticals ($VRTX / Biotechnology), sold 34.07% of his stake in a $6.9M sale on April 12th

# Notable buys from insiders:

* David Daniel, a Director at Domo ($DOMO / Software - Application) purchased 47,500 shares of stock in a $684K purchase on April 13th
* Tanner Geoff, the President, and COO of Simply Good Foods ($SMPL / Packaged Foods) bought 6,912 shares in a $250K purchase on April 10th

# High-Level Stats:

* Purchases increased from $1.7M to $9.7M (+460%)
* Sales increased from $700M to $1.4B (+103%)
* Transactions decreased from 481 to 326 (-32%)
* Companies represented in Form 4s decreased from 257 to 190 (-26%)
   * Net buyers increased from 9 to 16 (+78%)
   * Net sellers decreased from 248 to 174 (-30%)
* Insiders filing Form 4s decreased from 431 to 277 (-36%)
   * Net buyers increased from 11 to 22 (+100%)
   * Net sellers decreased from 420 to 255 (-39%)

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **April 10th - April 14th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of ‚ÄúP‚Äù or ‚ÄúS‚Äù. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. **Both indirect and direct** transactions are included in the reports.
3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **April 3rd - April 7th.**
4. **No companies without a ticker**
5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by algos behind Form Fore

678,Your lotto play for META's earnings tonight,DD,"Yesterday, I posted about MSFT's earnings [and anyone who listed banked hard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12ytt9u/why_im_getting_msft_calls_for_earnings/). The stock is up 8.5% today, calls up massively. My last earning post before that was last week with [Tesla](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12s2zqb/what_to_do_for_teslas_earnings_tonight/) which did extremely well too. Now we're looking to print more with META today. Who's ready? 

The company will report its Q1 2023 earnings today after market close. The Facebook parent has been one of the greatest beneficiaries of tech's year-to-date rally, the company's stock climbing nearly fucking *70%* in 2023 ($124 -> $211). The company's ""year of efficiency"" messaging and execution has resonated with shareholders (us), so the next question is ‚Äì can ol' Zucky keep it up? 

Here's what analysts on Wall Street are expecting to see out of Meta:

* Revenue: $27.67 billion

* EPS: $2.01

* Advertising Revenue: $26.76 billion

* Family of Apps Revenue: $26.88 billion

* Reality Labs Operating Losses: $3.8 billion

I expect the stock to beat the consensus estimates of earnings and revenues. The company outperformed the street estimates in the last quarter, despite a 4% y-o-y drop in the total revenues to $32.17 billion. The top line primarily suffered due to lower advertising revenues. Notably, the average revenue per user was down on a year-on-year basis. That said, the daily active users improved in the quarter. I expect the Q1 result to be on similar lines.

Meta's ""Year of Efficiency"" has involved substantial cost-cutting at the company. In March, Meta announced it would lay off [10,000 workers](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/14/meta-to-cut-another-10000-jobs-zuckerberg-says/), building on the company's previous layoff announcement back in November, which affected [11,000 employees](https://www.npr.org/2022/11/09/1134139800/facebook-layoffs-instagram-meta). At the close of 2022, Meta had more than 80,000 employees. The impact of Meta‚Äôs cost-cutting initiatives such as reducing its headcount will be scrutinized.

A number of analysts are coming into this earnings cycle with substantial optimism about Meta's trajectory (including me). JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth currently has Meta at Overweight and raised his price target on March 24 for the company to $270 from $225, reiterating the company as a ""top pick.""

""Importantly, 2023 may be the 'Year of Efficiency,' but we believe Meta is building the critical muscle for financial discipline over the long term,"" he wrote in the March note. ""Meta shares have more than doubled off their early November lows but we still think there‚Äôs meaningful upside ahead driven by accelerating revenue growth, continued cost efficiencies, and still attractive valuation.""

However, challenges remain for Meta, as investors will look for improvement in the much-talked-about losses generated by the company's metaverse operation, Reality Labs, which lost a [whopping $13.7 billion in 2022](https://news.yahoo.com/meta-reality-labs-lost-13-230453969.html). Reality Labs is expected to report a loss of [$3.8 billion](https://www.forex.com/en-ca/market-analysis/latest-research/what-will-big-tech-earnings-mean-for-the-nasdaq-100-outlook/) in the first quarter, up from a loss of $2.96 billion for the same period last year. However, this would be an improvement quarter-over-quarter, with Meta posting a $4.28 billion loss from Reality Labs in 4Q 2022.

Additionally, company watchers are hoping Meta can begin to leave the digital ad slowdown of the last year in its past. Early data indicates that, on the ad market front at least, there could be a light at the end of the tunnel. The decrease was due to a slight drop in advertising revenues, which suffered because of tough macroeconomic conditions. The same was evident from the ARPU figure for the year ‚Äì down 3% y-o-y. On the flip side, the DAUs increased by 4% y-o-y. I believe the Q1 results will follow the same trend.

""We think investors are cautiously optimistic on an improving digital ad market, while META has improved its cost structure and have given investors more confidence in management's commitment to profitability,"" wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black on April 24. ""Recent ad checks indicated March ad spend was higher than anticipated and engagement data with Facebook and Instagram has been positive relative to peers.""

So despite the Reality lab losses, I think META will beat estimates and will shoot up AH. So the play will be similar to MSFT, a call spread. I'll be getting META 4/28 215c and selling the 230c. This will cost $470, but can offer 3.2x gains if this goes our way.",2023-04-26 16:37:31,133,You‚Äôre a God and I didn‚Äôt follow you. Do you have a play for $AMZN or $NET or $SNAP today?

686,Net interest income and net interest margins. This is all you need to know about FRC and where it's headed.,DD,"No idea how so many people here fail to see and understand this. The crisis happen in mid-March. Their results were 10 weeks of ""normal"" followed by 2-3 weeks of stress. Those 2-3 weeks of stress had the following impact on their NII and NIM:  

1. Net interest income was $923 million for the quarter, down 21.4% compared to the prior quarter. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to substantially higher funding costs.  

2. The net interest margin decreased to 1.77% for the quarter, from 2.45% in the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily due to higher short-term borrowings, which was partially offset by the impact of CD withdrawal penalties that increased the net interest margin by 11 basis points.  

So if you extrapolate those couple weeks of stress to an entire quarter (which is what you'll see in Q2 and each quarter going forward), you'll realize that their funding costs have absolutely exploded and they are fucked going forward. 2 weeks of stress took out 21% of their net income and dropped their NIM 70 bps. Imagine what the next 13 will be like.    

They are borrowing like $100B from the Fed and got charity deposits for $30B from other banks. So $130B of their funds now have rates of 4-5%.  

They were paying on average 77 bps to depositors as of December 2022. Now they are paying more than 50% of their ""depositors"" 4-5%. Q2 is going to be an enormous loss, and so will every quarter after that. They have no way of getting cheap deposits back and their loans that can be sold are heavily under water (which is what the problem was in the first place).  

They're a zombie. They can't pay back the Fed loans since they need them, but they can't afford the interest on them either. The likely outcome is terrible for common shareholders no matter what. Best-case is a capital raise that completely destroys common shareholders. Worst-case the Fed just breaks them up over the next month by facilitating asset sales to other parties, forcing losses on FRC until there's ultimately nothing left (probably backstopping losses for acquirers or just taking the losses itself in what is essentially another bailout.)  

No way common shareholders are walking away with anything.",2023-04-25 09:25:00,133,$FRC Buy&Holdüí™üëçüíé

**The Fed**

The Fed needs to raise more, a lot more, at this moment, right now! 2023 US tax revenue is trending down about \~30% compared to 2022, but the US deficit is expected to exceed 2 trillion this year. Here is what‚Äôs bothering me: with the US government on a spending spree, how is the Fed supposed to tighten? The Fed is on schedule to shrink their balance sheet by 60 billion per month, which is less than 1 trillion a year. However, the US government is basically injecting 2 trillion a year into the system. I don‚Äôt see how liquidity can ever go down.

https://preview.redd.it/foiz1q4d4bva1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=031d7b2ef487d846fbae77c8fed02371603e52b5

Just a reminder that the Fed is only expecting 1% GDP growth this year and a 4.5% unemployment rate. So far, we are tracking 2% GDP growth and a 3.5% unemployment rate. The Fed is very far from done.

**The Economy**

This week‚Äôs economic data is confusing, to say the least. We got Empire State roaring higher on Monday, then Philly Fed face-slapping bad, and conference board LEI puking yesterday. But how can you end the week without another jumping surprise from SP Global flash PMI? Today‚Äôs data showed both manufacturing (11-month high) and service (6-month high) jumped to expansion territory. New orders are at an 11-month high, job growth is solid, and prices are higher too. JPMorgan said, ‚ÄúThe April flash PMI showed unexpected and broad-based improvement, suggesting further positive momentum in the US economy, a more sustained pace of expansion, and tighter monetary and credit conditions do not appear to be significantly slowing activity at this time.‚Äù

https://preview.redd.it/tt0x627j4bva1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3f76cc6f62bcb07b11f33e41296f37c9e147e8fc

So I was trying to find out why consumers and businesses are so resilient in a tightening environment. And look what I found: 

***Savings, so much savings.*** 

US household savings are still sitting at a historical high. And not just a little high, but 4X high! From 1 trillion before the pandemic to close to 5 trillion today.  You mfs keeps whining about inflation but look at how much cash you are hoarding!

https://preview.redd.it/qa4z1w1q4bva1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c55aea9e56c0a1b4fd52d247600d172ae18563bb

Even though the saving rate is down from 10% before COVID to 5% now, the absolute dollar amount is still higher than before COVID! 

https://preview.redd.it/lny8y60u4bva1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f3e25cc729edd07c9ab732d26ec905cb09d0712e

Corporate, on the other hand, has a cash position declining much faster, but still higher than before the pandemic.

https://preview.redd.it/6fsh3p3h5bva1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ccef7710c12ec864c583bf9d8009df8fdd44064e

The interest coverage ratio (calculated by dividing earnings before interest and tax by the cost of a company's debt-interest payments) is declining rapidly but still higher than before the pandemic. However, the debt-to-equity ratio is declining too, indicating that US companies are deleveraging (taking less risk).

https://preview.redd.it/e7nasw5p5bva1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b74506722af6f841e3f9bfc9126d6e0f5a5d28fc

Looks like it‚Äôs going to take the Fed a lot more rate hikes for a much longer time to bring inflation down.

&#x200B;

**The Business**

MSFT, META, AMZN will report next week. 

""With tech ownership super concentrated, results to come in these stocks are critical if this equity market is to hold. MSFT and NOW next week will be huge tests in my view. They do not have to be big beats or raises, they need to be clean and stable."" - JPM

Big techs are last year's biggest losers who turned out to be this year's biggest winners. Funds are looking for stability and safety. It‚Äôs not that the market is overlooking risks, but rather that all the risks are priced into small caps.

https://preview.redd.it/p879h43y5bva1.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cd89d78d157bdd68e915bb4778114e2b108640c3

So far, 76% of $SPX companies have beaten EPS estimates to date for Q1, which is below the 5-year average of 77%, but above the 10-year average of 73%.

714,U.S. watchdog says it found unacceptable problems with Chinese company audits,Discussion,"Apparently hundreds of companies are about to be de-listed.

Original Source:

https://www.reuters.com/markets/us-watchdog-says-it-found-unacceptable-problems-with-chinese-company-audits-2023-05-10/

WASHINGTON, May 10 (Reuters) - A U.S. accounting watchdog found unacceptable deficiencies in audits of U.S.-listed Chinese companies performed by KPMG in China and PricewaterhouseCoopers in Hong Kong, the government agency said on Wednesday.

The U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)published the findings of its inspections after gaining access to Chinese company auditors' records for the first time last year following more than a decade of negotiations with Chinese authorities. That access kept roughly 200 China-based public companies from potentially being kicked off U.S. stock exchanges.

The deficiencies were so great that auditors failed to obtain enough evidence to substantiate companies' financial statements, PCAOB Chair Erica Williams told reporters on Wednesday. The firms, two of the so-called ""Big Four"" in accounting, represent 40% of the market share of U.S.-listed companies audited by Hong Kong and mainland China firms, she said.

PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in Hong Kong said it is working with the PCAOB to address issues raised and noted the inspection report marks an important milestone for U.S. and Chinese cooperation. KPMG's firm in China said in a statement it has taken steps to address the issues the PCAOB had found.

While the findings are consistent with what the agency usually discovers when gaining access to a foreign country's audit records for the first time, they will likely raise worries among global investors over the accuracy of U.S.-listed Chinese companies' public financial statements.",2023-05-10 19:01:18,122,Color me surprised...

3. Financials/PR not released.

5. The biggest banks in the U.S rally to deposit $30B in [$FRC](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/FRC)'s accounts in an unheard level of support and show of comradery.
6. Fed still fighting inflation. It's not like banks are hanging on by a thread because of rate hikes.                          7.ER is just around the corner (\~1W) and the stock is still worth 10% of what it was 4 weeks ago -- all with not a single number shared outside of FRC.
7. JPM and other big banks post big profits for 2023 Q1. FRC currently down 6% from last week. So if the industry is doing good, why is there STILL UNCERTAINTY around FRC? This is so annoying. It's like everything I touch goes limp.

724,Fed‚Äôs Powell Tricked by Russian Pranksters Posing as Zelenskiy,News,"(Bloomberg) --Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell held a call with a pair of Russian pranksters posing as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, according to video shown on Russian state television.
Apparently thinking he was speaking to Zelenskiy, the video shows Powell answering questions on topics ranging from the outlook for inflation to the Russian central bank. There were several clips lasting about 15 minutes and it‚Äôs unclear if the footage was altered. 

‚ÄúChair Powell participated in a conversation in January with someone who misrepresented himself as the Ukrainian president,‚Äù a Fed spokesperson said Thursday. ‚ÄúIt was a friendly conversation and took place in a context of our standing in support of the Ukrainian people in this challenging time. No sensitive or confidential information was discussed.‚Äù

The spokesperson added that ‚Äúthe matter has been referred to appropriate law enforcement, and out of respect for their efforts, we won‚Äôt be commenting further.‚Äù

The Fed also said that the video appears to have been edited and cannot confirm it is accurate. 

Other Officials

While the comments appeared anodyne, the fact that the hoax call got through to Powell is likely to raise questions about security at the Fed. 

The pranksters - Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexei Stolyarov, who go by the nicknames Vovan and Lexus - have for years succeeded in tricking foreign politicians into talking to them despite their sometimes-crude impersonations. 

The duo are supporters of President Vladimir Putin. Back in 2018, the UK said it believed the Kremlin was behind a hoax call to then Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. The pranksters often post the videos with the intention to embarass Western policymakers.

Earlier this year, the two shared a conversation with European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde, also impersonating Zelenskiy, according to a video they posted. 

‚ÄúThe President agreed to this conversation in good faith, also to demonstrate her support for Ukraine and its people defending themselves from Russia‚Äôs war of aggression,‚Äù an ECB spokesperson said Thursday. 

The pair also spoke to Angela Merkel, Germany‚Äôs former chancellor, pretending to be former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Merkel appeared suspicious in the video of the call but didn‚Äôt question the callers about it. 

Last year, the pair tricked Polish President Andrzej Duda into thinking he was speaking to his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron.

The Powell call received wide coverage in Russian state media, which usually revels in the embarrassing episodes orchestrated by the pair. On their channel in the Russian VK social network, they devoted an entire show to it, including commentary from Viktor Bout, the arms dealer convicted in the US who returned to Russia late last year in a prisoner swap.",2023-04-27 12:17:26,118,There is no end to the federal government's clown show.
725,FRC - best scenario,YOLO,"I'm long.


2022 year end assets: $212B

2022 year end receivables: $158B

2022 year end cash position: $54B



(guess) 03-2023 cash position before crisis: $60B (approximate)

(Source somewhere present) 03-16-2023 bank run: $24B (source present somewhere)

(FRC) As of March 15, 2023, the Bank had a cash position of approximately $34 billion, not including the $30 billion of uninsured deposits from Bank of America, Citigroup, etc.

=> so, $60B(cash position before crisis, approximate) - $24B(withdrawal, approximate) = $34B(FRC)

Math checks out.


(FRC) From March 10 to March 15, 2023, Bank borrowings from the Federal Reserve varied from $20 billion to $109 billion at an overnight rate of 4.75%.

=> So, when the crisis started, FRC borrowed $109B to fully cover all deposits and as withdrawals weakened, its borrowing decreased to $20B. Somewhere here, it got leaked to the media, bank run was in the magnitude of $70B instead of $24B. I THINK $70B figure was the borrowing from Federal Reserve at some point and it got erroneously interpreted as bank run. This is my biggest guess.

So, the best scenario would be

1. bank run was about $24B instead of $70B
2. JPM and other banks put $30B because FRC did not need it after all and all other banks knew they'd get it back because FRC did not need it anyway. This is huge.  Magnus Billing, CEO of Alecta, got fired after losing $2B over SVB failure. No CEO would provide billion dollars, putting his job in danger.

This is my best scenario for FRC and I have 7,870 FRC stock, average about at $14.60.

Either I will retire or get retired.

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
* **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-12.
* **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

727,4/20 Yearly ASTS Update - Mixed bag or Future winner?,DD,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f6u0algfw1va1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=77f9bb3a3770ca479d48a17c50caf6bcd4cd55bf

Disclaimer: *I am only posting this yearly update as a way for me to journal my thinking and for future bragging rights (or to become an eternal WSB* ü§°). I am documenting my way to an 8 digit portfolio by the end of the decade.

Fellow degens,

Here is my **yearly 4/20 update** on holding $ASTS ([AST SpaceMobile](https://ast-science.com/)). Safe to say, if you had bought last year at $8 \[[4/20 Update 2022](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u7s7lm/the_gamechanger_in_mobile_broadband_connectivity/) \-- I invite you to read it for some context\] and held until now, you would be down >45%. Ouch. You would have underperformed (euphemism) both SPY and QQQ by a wide margin over the past 12 months... Ouch (twice). At least, I did. Ouch (again).

However, you would have had plenty of opportunities to sell along the way at $9 in June, $14 in August and $9 in November. And this would have put you well ahead of the indices last year in a down market. It has also outperformed it's peers (deSPACs are down c.60% over the same period and space-related deSPACs have mostly become pennystocks -- a few exceptions exist).

Although, I have been proven wrong so far (return-wise) and feel I jumped the gun too early. I continue to believe this is a company to follow closely. Here is why.

# Recap of last year, where I was wrong and where I wasn't

Last year, I had identified four categories of risks: launch, technology, funding and regulatory.

**I was wrong**. The launch didn't happen in June 2022 but was delayed to September 2022 (not the first time there is a delay with the company). However, **I was right** in guessing that the company had really well engineered it's deployment system and everything went out smoothly.

**I was right**. The technology to connect the satellite directly to an unmodified phone works ([CEO tweet](https://twitter.com/AbelAvellan/status/1647643784291704832)). I am expecting a formal event in the coming months to announce it with AST's partners (AT&T, Vodafone, Rakuten, etc.).

**I was right**. There seems to be a huge market for the service. Mind you. Last year, nobody was talking about D2D (direct-to-device) -- it was deemed impossible by industry professionals (just like landing a rocket was deemed impossible). Now, Apple/GSAT, Starlink/TMUS, IRDM/QCOM are all working on the opportunity. Do you think a trillion dollar company and multi-billion ones would do that if there was no demand?

That's a paradigm shift I didn't expect. Also, I believe AST to be a few years ahead at the very least (after the recently announced delay by Starlink and Samsung not adopting QCOM's solution).

It also seems like the FCC is doing a full 180 on regulations to accomodate for this new market. Something to watch closely.

**I was wrong**. I didn't see how shit the market would become and how difficult it would be to raise money in last year's environment. I am certain the constellation will get funded, too many stakeholders want to see it happen. Yes. **I was right**. Last year, AST had 17 partners under agreement and now they have **35 agreements covering more than 2bn people**.

# Is the risk/reward still as good?

At today's price, I still believe it could be a multideca-bagger and why not dream a little for a 100-bagger (it's valued at <1% of Starlink, yes Starlink, not accounting for SpaceX) by the end of the decade.

On the risk-side, we now know the technology works, they are able to deploy the satellite and close the connection. Remember. **This was something even industry professionals thought was impossible**.

Moreover, there has been no insider sales (not even the SPAC sponsor -- find me another company where that is the case). The last insider buys were at $5.5 and I am sure it's nice to buy below them (offers some comfort on the downside).

The technicals seem to indicate that we have double-bottomed.

# What's next?

There is a regulatory ruling by the FCC tomorrow (4/20).

As mentioned earlier, I expect an event of some sort with AST's MNO partners (AT&T, Vodafone, etc.).

I expect hard contracts and funding arrangements to follow or be announced at such an event.

A successful test launch of Starship (highly unlikely) is a small bonus as it will signficantly lower cost of launch.

I still think this is not for everyone. I believe that I shall be fine hodling long term. I know that for most of you long term is 5 hours and the only fundamental research you do is based on price action over the past week.

Risk of this going to 0 is still significant and it has been a dud so far.

# Position

I bought 2,000 more shares since last year. 42,000 shares ([proof\_1](https://ibb.co/XDWkSBL) \+ [proof\_2](https://ibb.co/RHH1Px7))

TL;DR: Well, I am one year older and still full of cum. The reward is identical to last year but now with less risk as the technology has been proven. Still a **potential** 100 bagger by the end of the decade -- only company I know who can immediately tap 2bn customer once service becomes live.

See you next year.

736,I feel like FRC is a trap,Discussion,"Reasons why I think FRC is a trap:

1. They postponed their initial earnings. It was supposed to be this week. Generally companies don't do this for good reasons.
2. While other regional banks have shown that their net deposit loss was rather small and that the bleeding has stopped, FRC is on the extreme end. They had to be rescued. This makes me think their net deposit loss is much greater but obviously the market has priced that in to some extent. But the question is how much. If it's greater than 40% of its deposits, then I think that's bearish.
3. Something unique about FRC is that it has a significant wealth management business. We saw that they lost of a lot employees here. If we get insight as to how much assets have left, that can be really bad for future earnings.
4. Nothing to do with immediate earnings, but it might get removed from the S and P index soon due to its financials.

To be bullish on FRC, you would have to assume that deposits are slowly growing again and they will soon reinstate their suspended dividends. I just don't see that happening. The only thing bullish about this stock is that it has a lot of short interest.

All in all, too much risks. Seems like there are safer plays with regional banks without the risks like KRE index or PACW.",2023-04-21 01:19:06,110,Nailed it !!
737,"Here we go again....Regional banks plummeting as short sellers circle, weighing on market, lifting Treasuries",News," There has been no particular catalyst for the tumble in the regional banks Tuesday (KRE ETF currently down 8%), with losses accumulating gradually from the open, but mainly after JOLTS job openings data entered the rear view.

The sell-off Tuesday is permeating across the regionals as a whole, rather than any specific banks facing an issue as policymakers had initially hoped. The First Republic takeover was a story for Monday, but the broader questions on the sector's future remain.

Short sellers appear to be actively targeting the regional banks now with questions over increasing funding costs and the sector being on the precipice of a regulation overhaul. The concern now for policymakers is contagion, and it's worth highlighting that WSJ's Timiraos wrote on Monday that the Fed would be assessing the market's reaction to the FRC takeover ahead of its rate decision on Wednesday.

Thus, it's of little surprise to see some of the hike pricing unwind in money markets, with a 25bps hike now priced at 80% probability vs 95% earlier today. Similarly, haven demand and lower Fed rate expectations are seeing Treasuries rip higher, being led by the front-end.",2023-05-02 15:26:31,110,Dunno what u on about. Market moon.

You gotta be down bad, broke, penniless, insolvent, bankrupt, destitute, impoverished, and financially challenged. Basically, you're so broke you can't even afford to pay attention!

Step 2) YOLO on 0DTEs:
Instructions:
Throw caution to the wind and go all-in on Zero-Day-To-Expiration (0DTE) options. It's like playing roulette, but instead of a ball and a wheel, you've got a bunch of Greek letters and numbers. Just remember, the higher the risk, the higher the reward!

Step 3) Winning or Losing, Just Don't Be in the Middle:
Instructions:
At this point, you'll either become a millionaire or end up a millionaire in debt. Either way, just take the absolute value of your losses or gains by standing between two walls, and poof - you're a winner! Don't forget, on WSB, there's no room for middle-grounders, so make sure you either win big or lose big - no in-between allowed.

‚Äúexecutives at five of the biggest banks, speaking on the condition they not be named, dismissed the notion of once again banding together to prop up First Republic, especially when it could mean paving the way for investors or a competitor to scoop up the firm at a bargain price.

One expressed a willingness to participate ‚Äì only if regulators forced the group to take action.

**Several banks would prefer that, if it becomes necessary, the FDIC seize First Republic and sell it off. Such a resolution, they said, would be cleaner, even if banks lose money. Some have already taken reserves.**‚Äù

The government has already said they will not aid in rescue. Big banks apparently are unwilling to help as well. The only possible outcome is a seizure by the FDIC this weekend. 

Even if a rescue plan is agreed upon, shareholders are going to be left with nothing. This is a lose lose situation.

754,Crayon Drawings for Impending Sell Off,Discussion,"After 500mg of caffeine and a 20-minute meditation, I felt particularly ""artistic"" and decided to doodle on charts with crayons. In this post, I will examine, in my opinion, the seven most important signals of the market: SPX (S&P), QQQ (NASDAQ), IWM (Russel), DIA( Dow Jones), VIX (Volatility Index), AAPL (Apple), and MFST (Microsoft).

Starting off with SPX, we can see that it has broken out of its long-term downtrend MOAT (Mother of all trends) and even broke out of its February down trend. Currently, it appears to be in ""no man's land,"" with the biggest form of resistance coming from the previous high in February. I personally see no reason for SPX to start pushing up above the February high, but if anyone has a reasonable explanation as to why it might, I am all ears. The RSI (Relative strength index) is at 62.58, and, as demonstrated by the white horizontal line, just about every time it gets to this area, it is followed by a significant decline. Looking at the MACD (Moving average convergence divergence), we can see that the histogram is in positive territory as well as the MACD line. However, it appears to be turning over and going to the downside. Keep in mind this is in the daily time frame.

[\[SPX\]](https://preview.redd.it/dzwozct586ua1.png?width=5588&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=86abb6a0d8d7d7cbc02432d994b6dbde9712ea53)

Next, looking at QQQ, we can see that it is beginning to stall as it is in extremely overbought territory. The MACD line has passed the signal line, and it is CLEAR that downside momentum is beginning. Since QQQ already went above its February high, the next high it would have to overtake is from August of 2022, which is roughly 5% from current prices. I personally do not think this rally makes sense considering the state of AAPL and MSFT which I analyze down below. Together, both stocks comprise roughly a quarter of QQQ.

&#x200B;

[QQQ](https://preview.redd.it/oqbokwe6n6ua1.png?width=4848&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d0dd067214e672f5caa3f3e0d52c7002e0fca618)

Similar to SPX, DIA has broken through MOAT and it heading toward the February high. However, it is in overbought conditions. I don't see a melt up from here and I think it is about to fall with the rest of the indexes. Maybe it pushes a little higher and then it is in for the reckoning.

&#x200B;

[DIA](https://preview.redd.it/8xoep9fbn6ua1.png?width=1980&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f79b69f2cc7b4f6fc6a41658dd4b6ba5c7649a83)

Here's where it gets a bit confusing for me, and any explanation is welcome. IWM looks like it is ready to pop. It is definitely ""the canary in the Cole mine"". It is oversold and on the MACD, and the looks like it is heading up on the RSI as well. It looks like it has room to run to the upper end of the trend line (shown in yellow). Maybe QQQ and SPX go on to drop while IWM pops but something tells me they are going to move in harmony.

&#x200B;

[\[IWM\]](https://preview.redd.it/y8qyjaob86ua1.png?width=5588&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f570b3fe86993b4356d7733e3613a80bbc17ce52)

The VIX is currently at 17.07. The VIX usually spikes with earnings, which are right around the corner. Additionally, it appears to be forming a bullish divergence.

&#x200B;

[\[VIX\]](https://preview.redd.it/djjx3cvc86ua1.png?width=5588&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bb3a01a0740a9be5d95e6587835908b761b21b53)

Do I even need to explain? I mean, if you had to take a guess... where do you think it is AAPL is going? AAPL makes up 7.08% of SPX and 12.43% of QQQ.

&#x200B;

[\[AAPL\]](https://preview.redd.it/rjbe5gke86ua1.png?width=5588&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b9687525211d64734143fda2e0eba5830a707164)

Finally, looking at Microsoft, it is trading right at its August high, with no catalyst to push it above this point. Microsoft comprises 12.68% of QQQ and 6.2% of SPY.

[MSFT](https://preview.redd.it/fmfgomien6ua1.png?width=1980&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=54265fcc272f617a4cf37b0c9797be88b2447edf)

In conclusion: everything looks like it is about to sell off. I am extremely bearish. I do not know \*when\* the sell off will begin, but I think it is wise to average into SPXS or SQQQ as current conditions present downside. In light of economic conditions, I find it difficult to believe that we are not going to be experiencing an earnings recession that would serve as a catalyst to the downside coming off of extremely overbought conditions.",2023-04-16 04:09:03,102,"just flip a coin, could have saved yourself an hour+"

I am trying to make sense of this non-sensical stock market which is just behaving like a child which did not get it's ice-cream.

Not all regional banks can be that bad. I understand about FRC, SVB, etc. and perhaps even PACW.

However, I do not understand about WAL as it seems to be doing just fine. Their deposits are rising and their business seems okay.

Many times, the stock market throws out all the stones including some diamonds. I am trying to become better and buying them at dirt-cheap prices. I did that twice with WAL and PACW and made a decent amount of money on them when they announced their results.

So my question is simple?

Should I buy WAL and hold for long term or is this one headed to bankruptcy? Also, please explain why?

Lastly, please keep your comments civil. I am sure that many folks besides me would love to get those above-mentioned diamonds for themselves.

Thank you very much. I appreciate it!

**The Economy**

TLDR, more mixed signals from durable goods data suggest a slowing economy, in line with other data this week.

US Commerce March Durable Goods Orders increased by 3.2%, exceeding the consensus estimate of 0.5%. 

This surprise beat was almost completely due to Boeing's big order form Air India (Nondefense aircraft new orders increased by 78.4%).

Capital goods orders, nondefense, excluding aircraft (represented by the blue line) actually decreased 0.4% month-over-month, vs. estimated 0.1% decrease. Shipments, nondefense, excluding aircraft (represented by the orange line), decreased by 0.4% compared to the estimated increase of 0.1%.

The AtlantaFed revised its Q1 GDP forecast to 1.1%, down from 2.5% the previous week, just one day before the GDP release.  Have they all gone vaca for the past 3 weeks? Tomorrow's GDP report is not going to look pretty.

**The Business**

TLDR, service sector is still strong, but goods are probably dead; while mega caps are beating estimations and about to make new highs (not quite yet), micro caps just made a new low. A song of ice and fire.

Hilton beat both the top and bottom line and raised its full-year guidance, indicating strong consumer spending on travel services. Visa reported similar findings, noting that ticket sizes were declining as inflation moderates, but growth remains strong in services, travel, and entertainment. Outbound travel from the US to all geographies remained strong at around 150% of 2019 levels, indicating that the consumer is still in good shape.

While the service sector seems to be still strong, transportation (indicator for goods orders) has been leading the decline. Dow Jones transportation index dropped 1000 points in 2 days. Who needs stuff when you can go places and snap some pics for the gram?

Meta beat both top and bottom line and lifted guidance. My personal take on earnings is that growth is very limited down the road. MAU barely moved while ARPU declined, and more importantly, operating margins were down significantly (31% to 25%) yoy, highlighting challenges from both competition and economic uncertainty. Reality Lab should be shut down completely, as it‚Äôs still struggling for direction after years of exploration. Finding new revenue is a must for Meta; it might as well completely pivot to AI. 

Same situation here for mega cap vs micro cap. As I mentioned in my weekend post, Large Growth is going to be the winning investment style this year as we face more economic uncertainty and a tightening credit market.

Passage of [SB 233](https://legiscan.com/CA/text/SB233/2023), which was just heard before the Senate Energy Committee and on April 25 before the Senate Transportation Committee, could spur new nationwide standards that make two-way charging the norm, not a special feature.

""EVs are energy storage on wheels. Why waste that battery, given how few miles most people use the vehicle in any given day?"" said Skinner, whose initiative was a major focus at this week's California Climate Policy Summit in Sacramento. ""But we need to make it as easy as possible.""

Electric car batteries can hold approximately 60 kilowatt hours of energy, enough to provide backup power to an average U.S. household for two to three days ‚Äî or far longer, if the home's electrical use is conserved.

On April 18, the draft legislation was heard in the CA State Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee. The bill is likely to pass later this year after being heard by committees. Result of [4/18/23 committee vote](https://legiscan.com/CA/rollcall/SB233/id/1304425) is very promising:

No real movement here from a supply and demand stand point.. However, a red day tomorrow almost certainly will turn 415.55 into a new supply (resistance) which will allow us to target 412.62 and eventually 404.3 again. 

We did again attempt a break through of 417.03 supply, however, that became a major resistance.

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g4p7nhhk6axa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1f55396efe044148ded5799bfc5edc5ac15481e1

This is a fairly textbook bearish reversal set up‚Ä¶ I actually was EXTREMLY tempted to swing puts overnight but im not sure if I will make opening hour or not. 

However, what we have here is a massive blue rising wedge with our extremely tight 4 day long red bull channel. Not only that but we put in a really nice evening doji star reversal pattern‚Ä¶ in doing sowe should almost certainly target 411.44 to 412.6 for tomorrow. 

415.29 is the red support line for the bull channel tomorrow‚Ä¶ which means bulls have to open green and hold green all day in order to hold that. 

I still will be looking for a downside move tomorrow. Tomorrow is pre-FOMC so we should expect some more ranging but also could see some risk off into the meeting. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 412.6 -> 415.3 -> 417  
 Demand- 404.3  
 Support- 412.6 -> 411.4 -> 409.2  
 Resistance- 416 -> 416.9 -> 419.6

The bulls once again attempted to breach 4198 supply on futures and found themselves with a very strong rejection much like back on 4/18.

We did not establish any new supply or demand levels but much like SPY a red day tomorrow should turn 4190 into a new supply (resistance) which allows us to come down and take out 4178 -> 4158 and eventually retest 4085. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i6boasel6axa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1c5f629708c3853bf1c430e6c589a9c2f465a22d

I actually believe that futures daily is far more bearish looking than SPY. You can see the large blue rising wedge we are trading within‚Ä¶ you can also see the really nice 4190 double top and rejection off 4200. 

With this daily double top and evening doji star reversal pattern‚Ä¶ there is downside to be expected tomorrow. 

I would target 4178 as a major support area to watch and then we can start looking at that key 4150-4158 support area. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4158 -> 4178 -> 4198

Now I generally prefer to show these all on tradingview but I wanted to show you the three daily charts all right next to eachother and compared right next to SPY‚Ä¶

Now these are all the daily time frame and what I want to point out here is the huge rising wedge on SPY with a downside potential target of 395-400‚Ä¶ this rising wedge perfectly aligns with the VIXs current falling wedge with upside target of 20-25, DXY falling wedge (which it just broke out of) with upside target of 103-104, and the 10YR yield that also just broke out today with an upside target of 3.75-3.85%.

If we are seeing the strength return to the dollar finally and 10Yr yield then we could be in store for some more SPY downside.

The VIX  itself is in two separate falling wedges‚Ä¶ a short term falling wedge which goes with the short term bull channel on SPY/ futures‚Ä¶ expecting outside of a pretty heavily red gap down on VIX that VIX breaks through its 15.76 resistance for tomorrow we should see a push back to the 17-18 range on the VIX. 

The VIX amazingly put in yet another 52 week low today touching 15.53. 

I would be fairly surprised to see the VIX not have at least a little rise going into FOMC‚Ä¶ especially sitting at 52 week low and the lowest level going into FOMC in well over 1.5 years‚Ä¶

Today ended up being a great day‚Ä¶ I actually struggled early morning during power hour. I was on the wrong end of that 10am dump and then was on the wrong end of the recovery. Honestly I think for the next week or so I am going to start sitting out opening hour like I used to as the last 1-2 weeks my opening hour trades have not been that great. 

After that honestly had a great day and honestly as a technical based trader the setups were really good. I did get stop loss hunted one time mid day but other than that everything played out pretty well today‚Ä¶ much better trading than Thursday and Friday. 

I was able to secure almost my full weeks profit today‚Ä¶ 

Today was a heavy lesson and good reminder of using proper risk management and when you have a successful strategy that in the end you have to trust it‚Ä¶ I got stopped out 3 plays in a row and took pretty decent loss to start the day‚Ä¶ but I didn‚Äôt get frustrated and revenge trade‚Ä¶ I stuck to my strategy and my take profit targets and in the end had an amazing day.",2023-05-01 20:37:40,98,This guy fucks soooo hard.

Now I have a theory‚Ä¶ and its definitely a theory but if you stay with me here you may see where im going with this‚Ä¶ 

Lets think about what we have coming up over the next two weeks‚Ä¶ FOMC next week followed by CPI the following week. 

Now this is gonna be a long winded message and if you just want the TA skip below. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ljk3avziwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c35e0e96ae160b5cb224d9d4049c3345df7df3d1

This is from the CMEgroup which many say to be the most accurate representation of future fed funds rates‚Ä¶ 

Lets take a look at what I highlighted here‚Ä¶ current fed funds rate is 475-500 and by new week that will as of right now 90% chance be 500-525‚Ä¶ 

What I want to point out here is that we actually just with that GDP data saw a huge shift in the forecasted market. Now look at what happened over night‚Ä¶ we went from a 26% chance of 450-475 rate/ 40.2% chance of 425-450 rate to currently now a 48% chance of 450-475 and 30.2% chance of 425-450‚Ä¶

What does this mean? This means that we actually just saw over night the market go from pricing in 75bps of rate CUTS by the end of the year to now only pricing in 50 bps of rate CUTS by the end of year‚Ä¶ 

Now last time I checked the market has always seen rate cuts as bullish and rate hikes as bearish‚Ä¶ actually what is even more impressive is that over the last month we went from an expected 35.9% chance of 400-425 fed funds rate EOY (aka 100bps of rate CUTS) to where we currently are as mentioned ago‚Ä¶ that means FINALLY the market is actually starting to believe jpow‚Ä¶ 

Now this is where im pure speculating and spit balling my theory here‚Ä¶ what if markets really didn‚Äôt believe JPOW last fomc? What if we ran up in hopes that JPOW was wrong and that we would actually cut 100bps‚Ä¶ well in less than a week JPOW is going to stand up there and tell the markets ‚Äúim hiking 25bps and once again as I said last meeting our base case is NO rate CUTS this year.‚Äù Now this time markets are going to start to believe him‚Ä¶ 

Then what happens next? Well we get CPI and boy do I think we get some CPI fireworks‚Ä¶ look at the price of OIL alone and the fact that current forecasts are for an unchanged YOY CPI/ CORE. Why does that matter? Well after 9 consecutive months of downward trending CPI we finally are about to stall/ rebound. What is that going to do? Well that is going to cause even more panic‚Ä¶ why? Simple‚Ä¶ JPOW absolutely can not (outside of an actual black swan market crash) stop rate hikes if inflation rebounds or even just slows its downward trend. 

When inflation is unchanged or more likely rebounds on May 10th markets gonna panic‚Ä¶ but I think they already know this‚Ä¶ they are going to have to with no choice price in even less rate cuts by EOY if not more rate HIKES by EOY‚Ä¶ 

So the question would be why did SPY just put in the biggest green day in over 3 months on seemingly extremely bearish new that is staring us down right now? Its simple‚Ä¶ market needs exit liquidity‚Ä¶ Today is going to be the highest volume bull day since March 31st. In my opinion and theory markets know May is going to be a very bearish month and that we are going to see a true drop (think 380-390)‚Ä¶ right now we are seeing this push back up into the consolidation range for a few reasons‚Ä¶ 1. Burn as many people already short (remember market is apparently the most net short since 2008) before the drop happens. 2. Big money needs to exit their longs and shares that they bought from 410-418 and 3. Big money is trying to get the best price they can on shorts. 

In no way should the VIX have dropped nearly 10% on the data and news we got this morning and not with what the market priced in with the fed funds rate‚Ä¶ This is a fake rally in my opinion. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/144zb3ojwhwa1.png?width=695&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d0ab5ac4958689ba6039f3656d548d1af6ee2878

From a supply and demand stand point we had a pretty killer and wild day‚Ä¶ We had a lot of changes‚Ä¶ 

We officially established a new demand (support) at 404.3 and in doing do pushed up to take our 406.74 and 409.18 demand. 

In addition we pushed up all the way to 412.62 supply and had a pretty solid rejection off of it. 

I see two scenarios playing out here‚Ä¶ first scenario is that tomorrow we will push up to touch 414.22 demand (to take it out) but close back under 412.62 which should reconfirm that level as supply (resistance) that would then pave way for a push back to 404.3 demand and possibly down to 399.07 supply next week. Or the second scenario would be that we just immediately turn around and sell off back under the daily 8/20ema tomorrow which most likely would result in 412.62 being reconfirmed as supply (resistance) 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

Now on SPY here price action wise this was quite the reversal and really did put a stop to the bears right in their tracks‚Ä¶ The biggest and most bullish thing I see here is that we came up and retook the daily 8 and 20ema‚Ä¶ While it is possible we could immediately double top tomorrow and drop back under the daily 8ema by EOD‚Ä¶ more likely than not this shows a pattern of continuation to the upside for tomorrow. 

Looking at this realistically we have now established a new range of 404.3 to 415.6. Upside should continue to be limited right around the 414 to 416 area. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jvukdyikwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2af13696c1d0162a86a8a2a23bd4cfac2995def4

We do get some more data in the morning which will be interesting to watch play out and how markets receive this data‚Ä¶. I honestly don‚Äôt have a high sense of direction for tomorrow but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see an attempt to touch and take out that 414.22 demand we left above‚Ä¶ doing so really would open up a lot more down side possibilities. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 412.6 -> 415.4  
 Demand- 414.2  
 Support- 410.6 -> 409.2 -> 406.9  
 Resistance- 412.6 -> 414.1 -> 415.2

Futures daily also had some re-arranging today. We put in a new demand (support) at 4085 and have push up to take out 4117 demand. We now are currently sitting just over 4158 supply with the next supply at 4178 and 4198. 

Much of the same here on Futures as SPY I do see a case to immediately turn around to reconfirm 4158 as supply (resistance) with a double top drop‚Ä¶. But I also see a case for push back up to 4178/4198 supplies first before we eventually push back down to 4085 demand and eventually 4040/4055 supply. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

Much of the same here we came down here and double bottomed nicely off 4085. In doing so we retook the daily 8/ 20ema and retook critical level of 4095. 

With the current down trend broken we should expect this 4085 to 4178 range to be our new range until fomc or something else breaks that trend. As of right now the closer we get to 4178 the more bearish we should find ourselves. 

I do believe we will continue this run up tomorrow but I believe we are just being presented and even better short opportunity for summer time.

Futures Daily Level  
 Supply- 4158 -> 4178  
 Demand- 4085  
 Support- 4138 -> 4110 -> 4095  
 Resistance- 4158 -> 4178

**VIX1D**

The VIX1D actually gets its own section today because it was so intriguing to me as while we only have now 4 total days of data‚Ä¶ todays the first day that didn‚Äôt make sense to me. 

The VIX1D, or the 1-Day Volatility Index, measures expected volatility in the S&P 500 Index for the current trading day.Taking an aggregated measurement of weighted prices across one- and zero-day P.M. settled SPX option expirations, the VIX1D calculates its value of expected volatility, according to the Cboe‚Äôs press release. Simply put, the VIX1D reflects the midpoint values of weekly SPX put and call prices for today and the next day in real-time. 

So that‚Äôs the definition of apparently what the VIX1D measures.. now lets look at the VIX1D today‚Ä¶ 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kda0aewlwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2f1c5d392b3f548a99e998dc001fa372e0c0ebe6

This is VIX1D on a 5min chart with HA candles on the left and standard candles on the right‚Ä¶ what does this price action show all day? Well it showed that the VIX1D had a MASSIVE drop over night (at open‚Ä¶ remember vix1d closes at 415pm and opens at 930am which I still think it should be the same hours as the regular VIX). After the massive gap down what did it to? It rose all day long and aggressively rose all day long.

Now why is that odd? Well lets think about this the same way we think about the regular VIX‚Ä¶ if we watched the VIX gap down about 30% at open only to close up 11.29% by the EOD what would you expect the price of SPY to do? You would 100% expect it to have a massive drop. And if it didn‚Äôt what would you expect? Well you would expect that there is a massive imbalance somewhere and that something isn‚Äôt correlating correctly‚Ä¶

So I see two ways this fixes itself‚Ä¶ we either 1. Have a massive melt down on SPY tomorrow to catch up to VIX1d or 2. We have a massive correction to the downside on VIX1D which then causes an even bigger rally on SPY tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/67049ibmwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=35e3cdcbb103f75f9abab9cfb3e5c9e221bec71b

Currently I am in the process of tracking VIX1D and finding a correlation‚Ä¶ I am not using Mondays data as its not helpful for me and my analysis so I only have 2 days of data‚Ä¶ so far what I have seen is that IF the 4pm to 415pm move on VIX1D is down (so the 415pm close is lower than 4pm opening on candle) SPY will open green the next day (no correlation on how green yet). I also see a correlation that IF the VIX1D closes HIGHER the day before then the next day SPY CLOSES red‚Ä¶ IF the VIX1D closes LOWER than the day before then the next day SPY CLOSES Green‚Ä¶ 

So if we look at this trend and data so far‚Ä¶ we should see a green open on SPY followed by a red close‚Ä¶ now of course two days of data is hardly anything to take a trade off but I continue to track this and plan to track this for the foreseeable future and analyze IF we can make a predictive guess‚Ä¶

But I share this data now because if that‚Äôs the case and data holds true we are actually setting up for a massive red day tomorrow with how aggressive the VIX1D rallied. 

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7ecgugpmwhwa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6af05cf1b69e9c6c89386be4d6f68ea716324554

Now this is where I continue to be a little dumbfounded‚Ä¶ I see zero basis for why the VIX would be down 9.66% today based on the GDP data and the change in the EOY fed funds rate expectations‚Ä¶ We should have seen a continuation on the VIX to the upside‚Ä¶ however, that‚Äôs not what we got and we now find ourselves back in this red channel from 15.05 to 17.1. 

This also brings us back under the daily 8ema/ 20ema. 

Now the question and the data I will be taking from today is does the VIX outweigh price action on SPY compared to VIX1D‚Ä¶ as in does a massive red day on VIX mean more than a massive green day on VIX1D. 

I also can not for the life of me understand while the VIX would drop 9.66% (meaning there is now less 28dte+ long term puts than yesterday) when a recession is pretty much imminent and the actual chances of a fed pause grow further and further away. There is a severe imbalance here.

Today was an absolutely frustrating day‚Ä¶ took a small loss on a meta put which im not even upset about‚Ä¶ 

But intraday trading today was absolutely frustrating and at times senseless‚Ä¶ It felt like almost all day we were set up for clear cut bearish movements. However, what we found was pushes to the upside just continued‚Ä¶. The hardest part about today was that I recognized we were in extreme bull momentum for most of the day and I even tried a few times to get in on calls (actually loss on a few or took profits too early) however the technical never set up for an entry‚Ä¶ and by time it actually set up for a call entry it had already moved.

Today was a lesson in a few things‚Ä¶ 1. NEVER and I mean NEVER fight extreme momentum no matter how good a play works (I struggle with this ever day like this)‚Ä¶. 2. We do not need to trade every single day‚Ä¶ recognize the days that are advantageous to your strategy and capitalize on those‚Ä¶ sit out the rest‚Ä¶ 3. There will be days that are the exception to the rule‚Ä¶ that doesn‚Äôt mean we change our rules to fit that day‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the exception not the rule. 

I am still thankfully sitting at my weekly profit goal overall right now but today took a huge chunk out of my weekly profits. Today was a frustrating day and one that you look back and say well obviously it was easy‚Ä¶ just buy a call at hold it all day‚Ä¶ well sure everything is easy when you look back‚Ä¶ but for anyone who uses any sort of technical analysis or price action reading or anything outside of FOMO‚Ä¶. Today was anything but easy. 

Remember‚Ä¶ tomorrows a new day and we have 252 trading days a year‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt have to trade every day‚Ä¶ also have a set amount every day that if you lose $xxx then you stop for the day and come back the next day‚Ä¶ one of the worst thing someone can do is continue to trade on a day that‚Äôs not made for their strategy and eat way and weeks or months of profit.",2023-04-27 21:31:48,91,Is there a way to trade VIX1D?

776,Leaked Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Request - Microvast DOE Grant Application - Oshkosh USPS NGDV Confirmed?,DD," TL;DR: Oshkosh confirms Microvast is supplying batteries and separators for NGDV for USPS in leaked FOIA FOIA DOE grant application with GM. This is the beginning of the next leg up, get in now and fill your bags before the news is released. 

Now the details..  

GM and Microvast recently won a grant from the Department of Energy (DOE) as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, which rewarded 200 million dollars to Microvast to build a factory in the US with GM support, to produce an advanced separator using IP from both GM and Microvast.  See here for more details: [https://news.gm.com/newsroom.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2022/nov/1102-microvast.html](https://news.gm.com/newsroom.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2022/nov/1102-microvast.html)

Recently Microvast had a great earnings, beat expectations on margin quarter, raised guidance, enhanced margin.  This led to a more then 50% gain in one day, and a bit of a short squeeze as many many people and institutions have been shorting Microvast into the ground and were caught off guard by the quarter's results.  Check out the chart and volume last 2 days.  Based on the limited move, there are still many shorts that have yet to cover, and interest is way up.

I believe I've identified some leaked information that will light the fuse on this rocket now considering the context that it finds itself right now.

This fuse is a leaked Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) dump that is the redacted joint application with General Motors and Microvast for the grant for their new factory to build advanced battery separator technology.

In this 240-page leaked redacted grant application to the Department of Energy (DOE) there is a boatload of very material information that has never been seen about the separator and the technology and the company.

In addition, there are several letters in support of Microvast applications from companies that have committed to purchasing the separators and other batteries from Microvast.  One of these letters appears to confirm that Oshkosh is in fact using Microvast batteries and separators for the USPS NGDV.

While you can read through the entire thing here:  [https://file.io/Xl1g1p2oqi7K](https://file.io/Xl1g1p2oqi7K)

I will focus this post on the Oshkosh / USPS / NGDV confirmation.

This was supposed to happen on April Fools but I goofed. So now at this entirely arbitrary moment in time, for completely benign, transparent, and non-nefarious reasons, we've launched a paper trading game integrated with the subreddit via a new Reddit feature called the Developer Platform.

You'll find that the ""..."" menus suddenly have new options in them. Most of the goodies are hidden in the one that's either next to the search bar on mobile, or in the sidebar on desktop.

The intention isn't to suddenly allow paper trading submissions. Having a fleshed out way to track your picks over time and a couple of leaderboards for fun seems like a great new vehicle to shame people in a comment section into putting a little more of their ego into a position, or y'know, whatever reasonable use you find for it.

This is a bit of a test launch, so go forth and try to break it, see if you can get on the top (or bottom) of the leaderboard, and believe us when we say for once, this isn't a trap. We promise.

RUM - Rumble is a massive disruptor in digital media, web hosting, and cloud services-- offering an alterative to YouTube and Amazon Web Services. Competing with Tik-Tok, Twitch, and Reels /shorts etc. you can get Rumble in your browser, phone, or TV app /roku.

So you, the media giants and talking heads, thought mass banning accounts in the most freedom loving country in the world was a good idea?

# So what the fuck does this mean

The thesis is simple. Most everyone was wrong about  Rumble's market share and thus its value.

Rumble has proven YoY growth exceeding other existing viral products like Tik-Tok, and now it has reached critical mass exceeding **80MAU (Monthly Active Users)** which means it's reached brand recognition phase and has massive momentum that should only continue i.e.

# It's a snowball rolling down a hill

Anyone who is already a content creator or elsewhere now must recognize the value on uploading their content to Rumble as they are currently paying out more in order to gain market share. (you can post to multiple services, obviously) People searching for content must also consider visiting Rumble to find what they are looking for as it's a place that may potentially contain what they are looking for.

This means the brand and its userbase has now reached a size where its own size is helping it grow.

If you're here on WSB you should be looking for something with a good risk to reward ratio, or in your case something with a fair to lot of risk but a fuck ton of reward. Obviously in your favor and not the dealer's

# Let's take a look at the fundamentals

RUM is trading for $9.33 a share or about $2.61B marketcap

They're holding about 337M in cash&eq , Net Asset Value is about 340M

Revenue is up a lot, up 316% 2022 vs 2021, Last Quarterly report \~20M in Revenue, here's some boring ass trajectories

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/on7vnr5i9jua1.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a8ad2aa703bd408eb61427c8d338b8772a9685d8

&#x200B;

Currently that would mean from the basic ass analyst's prospective the stock looks overvalued

(2.6B/340M) \~7.5x P/B (Price to book ratio)

20M a quarter at conservative growth call it 100M

(2.6B/100M ) \~26x P/S (Price to sales ratio)

# But fuck that shit

Let's talk about the sector they're in

20M/Q , call it 80M for 4 quarters for 'instantaneous annualized' revenue

With 80MAU this is 1 ARPU (average revenue per user)

# Why is ARPU so low?

\[link removed\]

&#x200B;

>**Disney+** global ARPU was **$4.30** in Q1, Domestic was $6.32 (subscription)  
>  
>**ESPN+** ARPU was **$4.73** in Q1 (subscription and advertising)

>**Vizio** ARPU was **$23.68** in Q1 (trailing 12-months), which is $1.97 a month (advertising)  
>  
>**Starz** domestic ARPU was ‚Äúaround **$5.70 to $6**‚Äù, in May 2021 and Lions Gate hasn‚Äôt updated it since then (subscription)  
>  
>\*\*Discovery‚Äô\*\*s overall D2C ARPU was ‚Äú**around $7**‚Äù, with Discovery+ ARPU of ‚Äúmore than **$10**‚Äù. These numbers are from July 2021 and Discovery hasn‚Äôt broken out ARPU since them. (subscription and advertising)

Current figures are pretty close to the above

The most similar product is YouTube had about $29B in revenue in 2021 and about 2.68B MAU this means **ARPU is $10-11**

It's reasonable to suggest Rumble's ARPU will change greatly from \~1 to at least 5-10

But why is ARPU \~$1 now?

It's simple, Rumble is paying out hugely to its users to incentive growth for the snowball effect

So earlier when it was stated (2.6B/100M ) \~26x P/S (Price to sales ratio), the market is really pricing in an ARPU of around 4 to give an actual future P/S of 6:1 which is more in line with these type of companies

&#x200B;

Another more fundamental prospective to consider is Revenue Per Minutes of Engagement

YouTube Reportedly Does 1B a day , this is \~30.5B hrs watched/month

Rumble Does 11.1B Minutes a month, this is (/60) \~ 185M hrs watched/month

YouTube reports \~29.24B in annual revenue, this is about $2.44B /avg month revenue

Rumble reported 20M for 1 quarterly revenue, this is about  $6.67M /avg month revenue

Meaning:

YouTube's revenue is $2.44B/30B hrs **\~$0.08 /hr watched or $4.88 per minute**

Rumble's revenue is $6.67M/$185h hrs **\~ 0.036 /hr watched or $2.16 per minute**

**This 2.26x as much per minute of viewing** which is another multiple of at least 2 when monetization is made proper, the view time per user will go up as well once the platform is larger with more users and content.

# RUM is currently fairly/under priced given this adjustment

So really the relative metric looking forward should be **Marketcap Per User**

&#x200B;

YouTube is worth 180B going off about a 6-7 P/S ratio \[link removed\]

Tik-Tok is valued at Around 70B

FB+Insta Reels is valued at (3B Rev \* 6.5 \~20B) \[link removed\]

The total value of this marketspace is currently at least 300 B

**This is 115x the current marketcap of RUM**

(in a growing market as well, that will be much bigger than 300B in the future)

>The global video streaming market size was valued at **USD 372.07 billion in 2021** and is projected to grow from USD **473.39 billion in 2022** to USD **1,690.35 billion by 2029**, exhibiting a CAGR of 19.9% during the forecast period.

# But that's just Videos and Clips

The total marketspace for RUM's existing products is

About 500B expected to grow to about 3.5T by 2030

This is present **192x RUM's market cap** to **1340x RUM's Market cap in \~7 years**

# Here's some Price scenarios for you

Currently RUM is \~3% Video/Clips Market (going off 2800MAU vs 80M) and sub 1% on the other two despite having a few very large costumers and some other topics that will be mentioned soon

(2023) 0.03\*400B \~ 12B ------------------(**\~5x in share price w/ current market share**)--**(bear case)**

(2030) 0.03\*1800B + 0.001\*300B  + 0.001\*1825B \~ 56B marketcap (\~21.5x in share price)

&#x200B;

*Roughly doubling current market share while adding minimal other products* ***(neutral case)***

RUM 6% Video Market + 1% Webhosting+ 1% Cloud services

(2023) 0.06\*400B + 0.01\*85B  + 0.01\*500B \~ 30B marketcap (**\~12x in share price)**

(2030) 0.06\*1800B + 0.01\*300B  + 0.01\*1825B \~ 129B marketcap **(\~50x in share price)**

&#x200B;

*Roughly quadrupling current market share while adding minimal other products* ***(Bull case)***

RUM 12% Video Market + 2% Webhosting+ 2% Cloud services

(2023) 0.12\*400B + 0.02\*85B  + 0.02\*500B \~ 30B marketcap (**\~24x in share price)**

(2030) 0.12\*1800B + 0.02\*300B  + 0.02\*1825B \~ 129B marketcap **(\~100x in share price)**

&#x200B;

**Moderately Strong Bull case**

RUM 40% Video Market + 5% Webhosting+ 5% Cloud services

(2023) 0.40\*400B + 0.05\*85B  + 0.05\*500B \~ 189B marketcap (**\~73x in share price)**

(2030) 0.40\*1800B + 0.05\*300B  + 0.05\*1825B \~ 826B marketcap **(\~316x in share price)**

Probably a bit later than 2023 for these numbers

&#x200B;

Short term

Bear case for 2023-2025: is $50/share - **Bull case is $223 a share (24 bagger)**

Long Term

Bear case for 2028-2030: is $200/share - **Bull case is $940 a share (100 bagger)**

So it's basically a **11.50c 9/16/27** priced at 2.09 .. this is a lot better than regular calls in most situations

* The current problems in the banking industry and their impact will factor into Williams‚Äô policy outlook, he said.

New York Federal Reserve President John Williams on Tuesday cautioned that interest rate increases will take a while to work their way through the economy before inflation returns to an acceptable level.

The central bank official gave no forecast for where he sees policy headed but said he doesn‚Äôt expect inflation to return to the Fed‚Äôs 2% goal until the next two years. Should inflation not come down, he said the Fed always has the option to raise rates.

He added that unemployment is likely to rise to a 4%-4.5% range, from its current 54-year low of 3.4%.‚ÄúBecause of the lag between policy actions and their effects, it will take time for the \[Federal Open Market Committee‚Äôs\] actions to restore balance to the economy and return inflation to our 2% target,‚Äù Williams said in prepared remarks at the Economic Club of New York.

TLDR: After the Fed hiked 25bp as expected, a June pause is on the table. Inflation indicators turned hotter in April with consumer spending leading the way. The US economy showed signs of a rebound in last week's ISM report, while global demand remained soft. The Q1 earnings season is coming to an end with results exceeding expectations. However, things may not be as bright under the hood. Regional and small bank pain may not have ended yet, with deposit outflow and commercial real estate being their biggest risks.

# Market-moving News

**The Fed hike 25bp and putting pause on the table.** On Wednesday, the Fed hiked another 25bp, marking the tenth consecutive raise and bringing the benchmark rate to 5-5.25%. This decision pleased both bulls and bears, as JP raised the possibility of a pause in June while emphasizing that the decision would depend on data. Inflation remains a priority for JP, and he seemed to be happy with the progress made in disinflation while keeping the job market strong. However, he did express concerns about tightening credit conditions, which we will learn more about in next week's SLOOS report. This week's summary of inflation-related news leans mostly towards a neutral to negative outlook, indicating an increased risk of inflation picking up again.

https://preview.redd.it/m3okmc85ngya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=88dcc9c4dba44dab8abf1246777bffce00b52368

**Economic indicators have largely rebounded from previous lows**, with notable improvement seen in the ISM manufacturing report released on Monday. The report indicated a recovery from the low point observed in March and surpassed expectations. However, it is important to note that both prices paid and received have increased, leading to higher inflationary pressures. Global demand remains weak, particularly in the European Union (EU) and China, while domestic economic activity shows signs of picking up pace. The Atlanta Fed has raised its Q2 GDP estimate to 2.7% due to robust consumer spending. Here is a summary of the major economic data from last month, with a focus on the manufacturing sector.

https://preview.redd.it/19eidn16ngya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=89dcf36afac3bcb84f09d95e809d93a7fc0ed8da

**Q1 earnings have thus far exceeded expectations, although there have been minimal changes to the full-year estimates**. As of Friday, 85% of companies in the S&P 500 have reported their actual results. Among the reporting companies, 79% have reported actual earnings per share (EPS) above estimates, surpassing the 5-year average of 77% and the 10-year average of 73%. In aggregate, companies are reporting earnings that are 7.0% above estimates, which exceeds the 10-year average of 6.4%. The blended earnings decline for the first quarter stands at -2.2%, which represents an improvement from the -3.7% reported last week and the -6.7% at the end of the first quarter (March 31). However, it is important to note that this marks the second consecutive quarter with a year-over-year decline in earnings. Analysts are projecting a decline of -5.7% in earnings for Q2 2023, followed by growth of 1.2% in Q3 2023 and 8.5% in Q4 2023. For the entire year of 2023, analysts predict earnings growth of 1.2%.

However, it is worth noting that Q1 earnings were skewed by three companies (AMZN, UBER, TDOC) that had significant losses due to write-downs from acquisitions in the previous year. In Q1 last year, AMZN wrote down 3.8 billion for RIVN, UBER wrote down 5.9 billion for Grab, DiDi, and Aurora, and TDOC wrote down 6.6 billion for Livongo. As these write-downs were removed from their balance sheets in Q1 this year, these companies reported substantial growth in earnings. Excluding these companies, the earnings picture is actually much weaker (though still slightly better than estimated).

**The regional bank selloff was the major drama of last week, and not without cause.** While the overall stock market remained relatively stable throughout the week, regional banks faced considerable challenges. Some regional bank stocks experienced a drastic decline of over 50% on Thursday, only to rebound on Friday. The roller coaster ride was largely impulse driven. However, there are potential fundamental risks associated with regional and small banks.

Let's start with the good news. Fed H8 (assets and liabilities of commercial banks) report was released on Friday. Notably, there continues to be a ""walk"" of deposits from both large and small commercial banks. However, the outflow observed during the week was smaller than the previous week, and the outflow from small banks did not surpass that of large banks (no deposit transfers from small banks to large banks like March).

https://preview.redd.it/wpiyiaj8ngya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8ca50f61a09ae9a2de4ea3d56d1c42e07689f88c

And what's more encouraging is that both large and small banks experienced accelerated loan growth compared to the previous week, particularly small banks, which exhibited the fastest year-to-date expansion in loans. This credit expansion typically signifies confidence from these banks and suggests they may perceive greater stability in the sector and the overall economy (although this is before the selloff on Thursday).

https://preview.redd.it/9pxizhd9ngya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ae4fc04e4b9daff014530a91c27b4b320f4ff39a

From the Fed's perspective, I do not believe they would allow any bank to default and depositors to lose their savings. While the Fed may not care much about small banks, maintaining public confidence in the overall banking sector is crucial. The Fed possesses the authority (via the ability to initiate monetary expansion) and the determination (as demonstrated by the swift bailout of SVB in just two days) to promptly address any potential systemic risks. However, this does not necessarily mean these banks will survive. Currently, there are two risks that should not be overlooked.

1. The risk of deposit outflows and a potential bank run is a significant concern. Fear and panic can often outweigh rationality in such situations. As long as people have alternatives and no compelling reason to bank with these small institutions, there is a diminishing incentive for them to deposit funds. This could lead to a gradual erosion of deposits or even a sudden bank run. I simply cannot see how the situation can be reversed in the short term.
2. Another major risk for small banks lies in their exposure to commercial real estate (CRE). In addition to potential losses on bonds and debt securities, these banks have a substantial portion of their loan portfolio tied up in CRE loans. As the value of commercial properties declines rapidly, the collateral backing these loans becomes weaker, posing a significant threat to the stability and financial health of these institutions.

https://preview.redd.it/cdc2zrmangya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1eeb9521bc3191e206577fb5473402709688063c

There are types of CRE loans, but the most significant issue arises from office loans. With the increasing number of individuals working remotely, the vacancy rates for office spaces in the United States have been rising and reached a new high in the first quarter.

https://preview.redd.it/i9chnp1cngya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6d70cefef0cca730984d58f7d4682794ff5ac286

As a result, these office properties are experiencing a rapid decline in value. Office buildings have already witnessed a 7% decrease in valuation since last year, and forecasts suggest that they could potentially lose up to 30% in value before reaching the bottom.

https://preview.redd.it/hawmw6vcngya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=84a6ee719ba919dd596c51ab4dc0f4f7047faeb9

Meanwhile, there is a pressing issue regarding the refinancing of approximately $700 billion in mortgages on office buildings this year. These loans will need to be refinanced at significantly higher rates compared to when they were initially originated, further complicated by the decreased property values. The consequences of tighter credit conditions and diminishing rental income have already started to emerge. The delinquency rate on office loans has been rising since the beginning of the year, contrasting with the relatively stable delinquency rates observed in other CRE loans.

https://preview.redd.it/j08op2qdngya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=865cdd8a224bdb5ce097ed24a89428bb916aada7

The financing rates on subprime commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) have been experiencing a substantial increase since March.

https://preview.redd.it/fady5ndengya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cab5199a150f589a8b9976720f5c6fc26b479c04

The concerns surrounding the office sector are undeniably reflected in the year-to-date (YTD) performance of office real estate investment trusts (REITs).

https://preview.redd.it/6ux2xq2fngya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=12b2b0a5d2db046c91cc08c7cd98b8359b6fb4f9

In terms of bank exposures, Wells Fargo & Co. holds the largest office exposure among banks, with a total of $36.14 billion as of year-end 2022. However, this exposure represents only 3.8% of their gross loans.

https://preview.redd.it/oqtiuj5gngya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5b60d425534231139e5c91e039b7ea6e122f301f

Which small banks has the biggest exposure to CRE loans? You guessed it:  New York Community Bancorp. (NYCB), which recently bought the assets of Silicon Valley Bank, has CRE loan exposure to the tune of 71% of its entire loan book. Other notable names on the list include EastWest Bancorp. (EWBC) with 39%, PacWest Bancorp. (PACW) and Western Alliance (WAL) with 28% and some other names which shall not be mentioned on this board.

In conclusion, while the overall banking sector may not currently face systemic risk, certain small and regional banks could face significant challenges due to deposit outflows and potential defaults in the CRE (especially office) loans.

# My positions and predictions

**US Equity**

*Valuation*

After this week‚Äôs earnings reports, 2023 SP500 EPS estimation unchanged last week:

2023 Full Year EPS: $221

NTM: $230 ($2 increase from last week)

2024 Full Year EPS: $247

Current forward PE 18.0, lower than 5-year average of 18.5 and higher than 10-year average of 17.3. In terms of valuation, we are slightly lower than last week (18.3).

https://preview.redd.it/50g1c0shngya1.png?width=726&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0d6b66f199928d9a09aa33f13a2e0bb90e1b278e

My investment thesis has not changed. The stock price is too high due to a low risk premium:

https://preview.redd.it/qjrh1ogingya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bd440532ce23c69f2bfe9897dea312ef702d57fa

If we apply a risk premium of 3% to the valuation of the S&P 500, the stock market today should have a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.4. Assuming the next twelve months (NTM) earnings per share (EPS) is $230 and the projected EPS for 2024 is $247, we can estimate that the S&P 500 index should be at 3542 today and 3804 by year-end (might be higher since the yield on Treasury bills is probably lower at year-end).

*Headwinds and tailwinds based on this week‚Äôs data*

https://preview.redd.it/yqw7qkpjngya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bf766ed0d1f6357b1170a824d2a4723c1dc8c925

*My year-end projection:*

My base case (shown in green) has not changed from last week. Assume SP500 earnings of $247 for 2024, with inflation stabilizing under 4% and continuing to decline. The Fed will pause after May hike and keep rate unchanged until year-end, before starting to cut in 2024. Year-end target is between 3920 to 4410 for SP500 based on 16-18X forward PE ratio.

Light blue box is where we are today. If we use 10-yr average forward PE ratio (17X), 3900 is a more appropriate level, and if we use risk premium model, we should be close to 3600.

https://preview.redd.it/284du8pkngya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c02005799217aa56b194fb64d94c4f46551b5e26

If the current ""Goldilocks"" situation persists, characterized by a resilient economy and consumers, along with inflation reaching 3% by year-end, small-cap stocks, particularly those in the Small Growth style, could present an interesting investment opportunity. These stocks are currently trading at attractive valuations and tend to perform well in a slow expansion environment with low interest rates.

Yesterdays post aged like fine wine‚Ä¶ I do wish I woulda taken a swing put but I have been actively trying not to take swings especially not 0dte. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/32iqlkijehxa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5b62419cb8f800846842aef98017f9daaa1ece9b

As of right now interestingly enough the chances of a 25bps hike went form 93.2% odds to a 84.7% odds today‚Ä¶ I am a little surprised about that honestly. But I would be very surprised to see a pause tomorrow. 

However, what might be of interest to you and what I will 100% be watching EOD tomorrow is the June meeting odds‚Ä¶ as of right now you can see 15.2% odds of a rate CUT and 84.3% chance of a pause‚Ä¶ only 0.5% odds of an additional rate cut‚Ä¶ Interestingly enough and this mostly is related to JOLTS im sure is that the odds of a 25bps hike in June went from 27.7% to 0.5% today‚Ä¶ Market fully expects this to be the last rate hike tomorrow‚Ä¶ What is even more interesting is the fact that we saw such an aggressive dump today‚Ä¶ 

This is what I have been saying for the last month or two‚Ä¶ we are barely staying afloat and price action (besides last Thursday/ Friday) have been a slow burn up‚Ä¶ this mornings opening hour $5 drop showed that when we sell off its going to be aggressive and fast‚Ä¶ not only that TECH today did NOT sell off with us.. at all‚Ä¶ If and when tech (which remember is the last to fail) is going to start the true heavy sustained sell off. Its coming in my opinion. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

So today we actually had a really big day S/D wise‚Ä¶ we managed to put in a new supply at 415.5 which brings us all the way down to where we closed‚Ä¶ in doing so we took out previous supplies at 415.25 and 412.62. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/azk0nfgkehxa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1fe7a0471a813307f15f92f0931c221370334fbe

That leaves us with a demand (support) at 404.3 and our last supply left at 399.07‚Ä¶. it would be one heck of a move down but a -2.9% day tomorrow (which is not unheard of on FOMC day) could get us to 399.07 by EOD. This does remain my target for EOW if we can break through and close under 404.3‚Ä¶. 

However, If FOMC is well received tomorrow there is a chance to immediately turn around and establish a new demand (support) at 410.84 which would leave us targeting a close over 417.03 by EOW. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nd9ooywkehxa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=00ab4c2212f383cbba3682f3e3b52613fa5ab535

We played out the textbook evening doji star overnight and this morning beautifully. We also as expected broke through that red bull channel. We now find ourselves within reach of touching the support of that blue rising wedge. That support sits at 407.52 tomorrow and resistance is at 418.81‚Ä¶ 

We also notably lost the daily 8ema and attempted to lose the 20ema today‚Ä¶ there is a chance we will retest the daily 8ema tomorrow and attempt to close under the daily 20ema tomorrow‚Ä¶ another closure under 20ema opens up 405.2 support to be retested. However, taking back the 8ema tomorrow opens up that 417-420 area. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 415.6 -> 417  
 Demand- 404.3  
 Support- 410.8 -> 409.1 -> 407 -> 405.2  
 Resistance- 414.8 -> 416 -> 419.5

Taking a look at futures here we too established a new supply today and in doing so have taken out 4178 and 4158 supplies. 

With 4190 now a daily supply just short of 4198 supply we should really look at this 4190-4198 supply as a major resistance level. 

Our downside target for tomorrow is 4085 and then eventually 4040-4055. We would need about a -2.4% red day to be able to come low enough to take out both 4040 and 4055 supplies. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

From a price action stand point same thing we played out the double doji top perfectly‚Ä¶ We did lose the daily 8ema and we currently look like we will close right on the daily 20ema. 

While I am looking for further sell off the daily 20ema is a very strong support. 4095 is our major pivot point also. The blue rising wedge support is at 4105 and the resistance is at 4230.

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4190 -> 4198  
 Demand- 4085  
 Support- 4135 -> 4110 -> 4095  
 Resistance- 4180 -> 4190 -> 4236

FINALLY the VIX broke out of both falling wedges and in doing so absolutely slapped spy down with it‚Ä¶ but just like March the bears were not able to keep the VIX elevated long enough which caused by EOD this massive recovery on SPY. 

With a closure back over the VIX daily 8ema and attempting to close over 20ema then we could look for a closure over the VIX 20ema and under SPY daily 20ema tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

This is the daily chart of the VIX1D as you can see it had a massive move up today. Putting in nearly a 100% day closing up 97.02%... this is the biggest green closure on the VIX1D since inception‚Ä¶ notable is that the last time the VIX1D closed very green like this was Tuesday April 25th when it closed up almost 47% and the next day SPY closed down 1.59%...

Relatively low trading day today for me as I only traded from 930 to 1130 and then 230 to 330 as I was at my sons field day. But man did we absolutely SLAY it today!

I coulda have about 20% if I held but I had already gone 2x my normal size and knew realistically there would be a huge rebound like we had today‚Ä¶ 

I had planned to open new longer dte puts again but want to wait till after FOMC‚Ä¶ I do still have this odd feeling we get a weird hard pump on FOMC that then lets us bring it back down EOW or next Week. 

I am still bearish honestly. I still do think we see 390-395 by EOM.

805,Alarm Signals in Bank Reports,Discussion," I continue to discuss banks, as  nearly all the reports presented today have (surprisingly!) exceeded  expectations. Here's a brief overview of the numbers and what I'm paying  attention to:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Bank of America (BAC)

‚Äî Revenue reached $26.3 billion, surpassing the forecast of $25.25 billion.

‚Äî Earnings per share (EPS) were $0.97, higher than the expected $0.81.

‚Äî  The bank's deposit volume decreased by almost 8% to $1.9 trillion, and  the bank also lowered its forecast for interest income (income from  deposits, loans issued, etc.).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Goldman Sachs (GS)

‚Äî Revenue totaled $12.2 billion, falling short of the $12.83 billion forecast.

‚Äî EPS was $8.79, exceeding the $8.24 expectation.

‚Äî Revenue decreased by 5% year-over-year, and EPS dropped by 18.3%.

‚Äî  In the future, the bank may increase income due to the newly announced  Apple Savings Account, which will generates 4.15% annual interest.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Bank of NY Mellon (BK)

‚Äî One of the oldest banks in the US reported revenue of $4.4 billion and an EPS of $1.12, in line with market expectations.

‚Äî Revenue increased by 11% year-over-year (partly due to a 52% rise in net interest income), and EPS grew by 30%.

‚Äî  However, the volume of assets under management declined by 16% to $1.9  trillion due to market influence (i.e., client asset withdrawal).

Still, the reports are far from ideal news, and the market seems to agree:

* Bank of America was up 2% in pre-market but has since lost around about 0.7% from yesterday's close
* Goldman Sachs is down approximately 1.5%
* Bank of NY Mellon has reduced losses and now sees a 0.25% increase
* S&P 500 index futures are hovering around the zero mark, while gold has risen, adding 0.7%

However, the market is currently highly volatile, and so the picture may change by the close of trading.

**Conclusion:**

As  I mentioned earlier, credit institutions are unanimously stating that  they're cutting costs and increasing return on capital. Simultaneously,  the banking crisis that began with the Silicon Valley Bank story is  already causing deposit outflows and other challenges. As a result,  banks need to increase loan reserves. Therefore, I prefer to stay away  from bank stocks for now.

I might  consider taking partial profits in the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE US)  today. In the current situation, it's better to secure a small profit  from the transaction than to wait and see where things end up.

Let me explain‚Ä¶ going into this week I was fairly confident in a hot CPI which would have bene the bearish catalyst for no rate cuts, no pause and another 25bps rate hike in a month at FOMC‚Ä¶ however, that did not obviously happen with that ‚Äúcooler‚Äù CPI print we now find ourselves just barely scraping by from a market sell off‚Ä¶ however, as this EOW price action would suggest we don‚Äôt quite have the upside pressure bulls should have hear to take this higher. 

We truly are in an extremely painful spot in this market‚Ä¶ theta and IV crush is hitting like no other‚Ä¶ there is no trend and there is absolutely no continuation. We are so far in my opinion overbought that I find it highly unwise to go long (plus I truly believe this market is literally scraping by on fumes and one of these days is going to let go) however, we clearly are being held up by big tech that its very unwise to go short‚Ä¶ so what are we left to do here? Well first off ALWAYS remember CASH IS A POSITION! But honestly this is a day traders dream as we have some pretty solid movement that is really setting up for some nice intraday plays. 

I truly looking at the technicals (Which I will cover below) believe we are about as close to the top of this trend as we are going to get‚Ä¶ however, we haven‚Äôt gotten the signals and flashing red lights that its time to go short‚Ä¶ for now its time to play the range and wait for us to pick a direction‚Ä¶

On tesla Daily here we got a lot going on.. so I was VERY much so bullish EOD yesterday and was looking for the pump‚Ä¶ the tesla ceo news caused the pump to the 173.98 targets I was looking for. Now this is where you gotta remember ‚Äúbuy the rumor sell the news.‚Äù What actually happened is that this huge pump put in a huge high volatility bearish day‚Ä¶

This is what we have right now is a bearish engulfing daily candle (4 day long actually), a failed breakout of this downward channel, and a closure back under that 168.57 demand which is the daily 8ema‚Ä¶ this was a massive failed breakout and with this rejection a new supply at 172.27 was put in‚Ä¶ that means our target is now the 160.87 supply. We also have bearish daily IV and with bearish price action. We also loss the red support line which was a 3 point touch‚Ä¶ 

My ultimate target for next week is 160.87 (-4.3%) with an extreme target of 153.8 (-8.9%). 

I took a half sized 167.5P 7dte put play for this‚Ä¶ looking to hold till at least 160.87.

Well until the EOD pump (a classic for SPY) I was actually thinking we might finally see SPY rebalance itself by closing under that 411.15 supply. However, we actually closed back over that supply so as of right now we still would be considered imbalanced. So this still either needs to close under 411.15 OR attempt to turn 411.15 into demand (support). As of right now we are in the process of discovering our next demand (support). However, I do not have a true target for that yet. 

It is extremely difficult (on spy at least) to find where this wants to end up‚Ä¶ Our biggest support targets are 404.3 to 405.06 and resistance is 415.56 to 417.03. 

**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

The weekly supply/ demand chart actually is the one thing right now that makes me VERY bearish‚Ä¶ one of the indicators I use (I do apologize I can not share it nor can I discuss the interworkings of it) has officially finally signaled a BEARISH weekly reversal‚Ä¶ what does this mean? It means that we finally have reached a place where the technicals are supporting further downside. 

Spy weekly did close below that 411.87 demand (support) that does open up a chance for a drop to at least the weekly 20ema which is 404.03‚Ä¶ a bigger retrace would be to the 385.9 or 385.21 demand. However, outside of a black swan I would be shocked to see us go that low‚Ä¶ most likely scenario is a retrace to the 390-400 area where we could actually establish a new higher demand (support) in order to propel us back to the 412-416 area. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

This daily trend is straight barcode‚Ä¶ no other trend to be had here‚Ä¶ WE actually for the last 6 trading days have CLOSED within the same $2.99 range‚Ä¶ that is a very tight range. 

The most bearish thing I can take away from this is that we now have a 3 point touch blue resistance line and did lose the support of the blue 3 point support‚Ä¶ this opens up the potential to touch the support line for the bigger black rising wedge. That support sits at 408.2 for Monday. However the biggest bullish thing I can see here is that we have now for 3 trading days in a row bounced off the daily 20ema and closed over the daily 8ema. 

With this bearish engulfing daily candle and rejection off resistance/ losing support I would personally favor downside with a target of 408.9.

**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/red74ovktgza1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7a28c030558af3dedbacf44bfaebfc8c546743a8

A completely uneventful weekly chart here‚Ä¶ we are still closing within the same $4.35 trading range for the 5th week in a row and we are still in that bigger $9.7 range for the 7th week in a row‚Ä¶

Now this rising wedge is about to come to a finally support test‚Ä¶ 410.61 is that key weekly rising wedge support. If that line breaks then that would in my opinion indicate a bigger sell off is about to start. WE also have a nice carrot top (v-top) forming here too. We actually have an extremely tight breakout/ down triangle here on SPY weekly with support at 410.61 and resistance at 411.78. 

One very real scenario here is that we are going to see a fake breakout/ down and continue to range here.. I still personally would not be going long or short until minimally this $4.35 range is broken. 

SPY Weekly Levels  
 Supply- 416  
 Demand- 411.9 -> 385.9  
 Support- 411.6 -> 407.1 -> 404.4  
 Resistance- 416 -> 422

Now this daily futures chart actually shows a much different story‚Ä¶ we actually today with this sell off managed to reconfirm 4153 as a KEY supply/ resistance. This supply is so important and strong that I actually am going to highlight it with a different style line‚Ä¶ we did managed to close under the 4135 demand (support) too. With this 5 closures between 4133 and 4154 finally being broken there actually is a bigger chance of a sell off here‚Ä¶ 

Our downside target would be 4074 on any major sell off. However, our upside target would be 4154 then 4190/4198 IF we managed to have a hefty bounce Monday.

The futures weekly chart also shows bearish reversal conditions now too‚Ä¶ I would have liked to see a closure under the weekly 8ema but we did retest 4173 supply (resistance) on the weekly and to the point rejected it. Our target still once again remains 4054 on a weekly time frame. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

The futures daily chart does make me feel and want to be far more bearish then SPY‚Ä¶ We did manage to close below the daily 20 and 8em and closing under that 4134 support area. One other thing is that we perfectly rejected that blue resistance line making it a 4 point (extremely strong) line to watch. We also lost that 3 point support line. The final support now is the black rising wedge support at 4105 on Monday and the blue resistance would be 4160 on Monday.

Futures weekly in my opinion is showing a far different and far more bearish chart then SPY‚Ä¶ what I am seeing here is that we are now closing below that month long range support of 4138. We did attempt to close under the weekly 8ema however, that eod push up of course stopped us from doing that‚Ä¶ 

Our breakout triangle support is 4125 and resistance is 4140.

One thing I have highlighted here is that the 7 week post JPM collar (quarterly) roll is next week‚Ä¶ now what USUALLY happens on week 7? Well usually what ever trend (Currently bullish) we are in will see a sizeable retrace from weeks 7 to week 11‚Ä¶ 

Now when we keep in mind that there are perfect spy/ futures weekly bearish reversal conditions and that our breakout/ down triangles are coming to a point we very well might finally be seeing the top of this market‚Ä¶ IF you believe in historical trends this is our opportunity to short. One thing to keep in mind is that occasionally week 7 will be the peak and the retrace doesn‚Äôt happen till week 8‚Ä¶ I have a bigger target of 4000 for futures if this trend was to hold true‚Ä¶ So far this trend has been a solid one to watch since 2022. 

**VIX**

Tough trend here on the VIX as we actually broke through both support and resistance of the short term triangle‚Ä¶ so we redraw that and re-evaluate next week‚Ä¶ we are seeing that this 16.8 area is becoming a major support area‚Ä¶ WE did once again fail to break through 17.72 though.

We should watch these two key levels for a direction‚Ä¶ I will say from a volatility/ iv/ price action stand point I am actually seeing further downside on the VIX for now‚Ä¶ 

**10YR YIELD AND DXY**

The biggest thing I have said im watching for is the DXY recovery and 10YR breakout‚Ä¶ we have part one which is the DXY breakout and holding that breakout‚Ä¶ the last step is for the 10yr to breakout‚Ä¶

We are truly about as close to the top as we arguably are going to get‚Ä¶ the signs are not 100% aligned yet‚Ä¶ but there are a lot of things aligning that a sizeable correction is inbound.

Last week I put in my best week of profits for 2023 and I was 100% not trying to chase those gains as I know that is how people put themselves in a really bad spot and start taking poor trades and not securing profits‚Ä¶ well after a very painful Monday and Tuesday I was able to secure my now most profitable week of 2023 again.

This is a yolo post and I don‚Äôt want to become one of those 20 paragraph DD posts BUT I‚Äôd like to explain my thesis.

SVB‚Äôs bank run started because they had liquidity issues. More specifically, they talked about intentions to raise money. THIS caused a bank run on an otherwise perfectly healthy bank. 

Now comes FRC. They are on the verge of collapse already having lost over 100 billion in deposits and borrowing billions from the fed at a 4.5% interest rate. Four U.S. bank said that the government told it to be ready to act on the First Republic situation last week. 

So they‚Äôre talking about need to rescue FRC, and tons of articles are coming out about how fucked they are. If depositors pulled out of SVB over a share offering, they have 10x the reasons to pull out of FRC. Yes, deposits will likely be insured but why take the risk when you can easily switch. 

Almost every theoretical solution being proposed is likely to wipe out share holders. For me this article very clearly breaks down how all the solutions will fuck shareholders: https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/04/26/first-republic-rescue-pitch-help-now-or-pay-more-later-when-it-fails.html",2023-04-26 20:24:50,78,"Solid logic, if you could replicate that, what is your next 'gamble'?"

830,What I'm doing for PLTR earnings tonight,DD,"Today after-hours, Palantir is reporting latest earnings. Analysts are predicting earnings of $0.040 per share compared to earnings of $0.020 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. They're also expecting the company to report $505.8 million, an increase of 13.32% over the prior year quarter. Looking at the full year, analysts expect a profit of $0.207 per share. In the previous year there was a profit of $0.060 per share.

Over the last 2 years, PLTR has beaten EPS estimates 50% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 100% of the time. Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 4 upward revisions and 3 downward. Revenue estimates have seen 1 upward revision and 7 downward.

The data intelligence software company in mid February reported Q4 2022 results that beat estimates on both top- and bottom-line. The company also [forecasted](https://www.reuters.com/technology/palantir-expects-2023-be-first-profitable-year-sees-ai-driving-growth-2023-02-13/) 2023 to be its first year of profitability, sending its shares higher by more than 20%. I do expect the company to move towards sustainable operating profitability, especially with the recently announced [expansion](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pltr-stock-palantir-expands-microsoft-cloud-computing-pact-to-government-agencies/) of the company's cloud partnership with Microsoft (MSFT), which opens up a new revenue source.

However, PLTR shares have struggled since the company's strong Q4 report, having fallen about 20% up till their last close. In addition to this, the company in late February joined the string of technology firms that announced layoffs amid an economic slowdown. PLTR said it would reduce its workforce by around 2% in an effort to reduce costs. However, this isn't necessarily bad news.  Citi on Thursday said PLTR is likely to keep dealing with challenges posed by ""incremental commercial headwinds,"" despite ""resilient"" spending from the federal government.

**What to do for earnings?**

PLTR has moved on average 4% with earnings, but with a large standard deviation. I don't think there's sufficient news to predict whether it'll go up or down with any degree of confidence. However, due to low strike prices, options are really cheap. I'm picking up 5/12 8p at 58 bucks a pop. If the stock were to drop 4%, that wouldn't be a big enough move to deem the puts profitable. However, I'm treating this as a lotto play, hoping for a larger move downward; while not exactly 'expecting' it.

We continue to try and work through the rebalancing on SPY daily supply/ demand right now‚Ä¶ We had a previous Supply at 411.04 that we did indeed come down and take out today‚Ä¶ next target is 409.73 supply followed by 409.18 demand. If we break through those levels and close we would then start to target 406.61 demand and 405.17 supply. 

My ultimate target and where I hope to sell my 92dte puts is 399.07.

We are seeing price action signal a downside move now and we are attempting to break extreme momentum on SPY daily. 

Something I will touch more on tomorrow night is that we are also attempting (if we hold here at close tomorrow) to turn this 412.63 weekly double top into a new supply‚Ä¶ That would mean we have taken out 409.98 weekly supply and can begin targeting 385.9 demand down below‚Ä¶ granted I don‚Äôt think we will get that low its where our target would be until a new weekly demand comes in.

We for the first time in almost a month of trading have officially closed a daily candle below the 8ema‚Ä¶ this is the first step in a bearish reversal‚Ä¶ however, until momentum is fully broken and starts to push down we could still see the 20ema bounce us which should be right around that 409 price area tomorrow. 

We also have a new breakout triangle forming here at 412.2 resistance and 408 support tomorrow. 

The bears ideally want to see this close under 408 tomorrow and under the daily 20ema‚Ä¶ IF we get that closure then I would start targeting 405.2‚Ä¶ However if we close back over the daily 8ema tomorrow at 412 then realistically upside target would be the 414-415 area again. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 409.7 -> 405.2  
 Demand- 409.2 -> 406.6  
 Support- 409.6 -> 409.1 -> 408

I have said a few times now I prefer watching supply and demand on the daily for futures as the price action is far more smooth then SPY‚Ä¶ this continues to be the case and I continue to see 4178 supply as a key resistance. With a closure under the daily 8ema we should once again start to target 4116 demand. IF we break through that level we have a pretty steep descent to 4040/4055. 

Weekly wise we are attempting to establish a new 4173 supply which takes out current weekly 4149 supply and makes our downside target at 4055 supply.

We once again broke pretty much the last support I see from this bull run up today. With this support being broken we will now look for the daily 8ema to turn into resistance and we will watch this new black resistance line. 

Target should remain the daily 20ema which will hover right around 4120 tomorrow.

I saw someone compare the VIX in 2008 to current VIX and thought I would look for myself‚Ä¶ now past does not predict the future BUT if we analyze these two charts there is a case to be made that the previous peak on the VIX we hard in March is the peak of July 2008‚Ä¶ and that the September VIX bottom is our current bottom‚Ä¶ IF that is the case then the major leg down is about to start‚Ä¶

VIX broke through resistance today and closed a nice doji‚Ä¶ however, failed to close over the daily 8ema once again. We will watch that key 17.1 level and 17.74 level tomorrow‚Ä¶ a closure over the 8ema to end the week could bring a bearish move next week‚Ä¶

I had a pretty decent day trading today.. as you can see mid day today I got really chopped up‚Ä¶ I had saw the reversal conditions forming on the 5 and 15min chart around 1pm and I was attempting to get in on it. Of course I got stop loss hunted 2 times in a row and took some small profits on the way down‚Ä¶ I missed out on that whole leg down as I kept waiting for a good reentry that didn‚Äôt feel like chasing. 

I was very salty getting stopped out and then it immediately rejected back to a profitable spot. But that‚Äôs the name of the game. We cant always and wont always get every move and our timing as much as we try to be perfect will never be perfect every single time‚Ä¶. But in the end we put in a really nice profitable day again today‚Ä¶ 

As of right now (if I didn‚Äôt trade tomorrow) This is my most profitable trading week since the first week of March. I am looking forward to ending tomorrow on another good note as this has been a great week of trading.",2023-04-20 21:50:18,78,"Thoughts on

New orders (ie DEMAND) at US firms increased at the sharpest rate for 11 months in April as new client wins, improved customer confidence and successful marketing strategies drove the uptick.

Unfortunately price pressures have skyrocketed in April:

Following back-to-back months of softening cost pressures in February and March, **April data indicated a pick-up in rates of input cost and output charge inflation**. Operating expenses rose at a marked and historically elevated pace that was the steepest for three months. Hikes in supplier prices were often attributed to greater incremental increases in material costs during the month. Manufacturers and service providers alike recorded sharper increases in cost burdens. Meanwhile, overall output prices rose at the fastest pace for seven months. F**irms stated that more accommodative demand conditions allowed them to continue passing through higher interest rates, staff wages, utility bills and material costs to clients.** 

**On Services Inflation:**

Reports of further and more notable hikes in supplier prices drove up the rate of cost inflation during April. The pace of increase in operating expenses was the quickest since last November. Firms were able to partly pass this through to customers, however, as selling prices increased at a sharp and historically elevated rate.",2023-04-21 13:57:52,79,Sir this is a casino

The market once again does NOT believe JPOW and with the psyops of the banking issues market forgot and thinks banking is safe now‚Ä¶ What we are seeing here is a front running of a pause‚Ä¶ however, I think come Wednesday next week when we get CPI markets gonna get humbled‚Ä¶ and in a big way‚Ä¶

Based on what we are seeing (I don‚Äôt have all the Bloomberg estimates though) but as of right now minimally we are going to get a CPI YoY unchanged or upside miss‚Ä¶ in addition CPI MoM will once again rebound in a big way‚Ä¶ This is in my opinion the catalyst that the market needs to start a true sustainable leg down‚Ä¶ why? Because its not a short term reaction‚Ä¶ a rebound in CPI starts a trigger of many different things‚Ä¶ the market has to price in the fact the fed is NOT going to pause, it has to price in a 25bps hike, has to start worrying about CPI pushing back up which causes a 25bps rate hike which puts more pressure on these banks and could cause more to fail‚Ä¶ this in my opinion is the Armageddon‚Ä¶ 

However, IF by some miracle we scrape by with a CPI YoY that comes in at 0.1% lower than previous YoY‚Ä¶ I truly think nothing outside of a true financial system collapse will keep this sustained below 405‚Ä¶ We honestly would be on a path back to 430-440 if CPI comes in lower than expected‚Ä¶ 

**BRONTOSAURUS** 

What is a bronto day? Essentially what it is is a day where there is far more buying then selling‚Ä¶ one where VOLD (which measures the up/ down volume of the NYSE) prints only green candles all day long‚Ä¶ 

Today if we look at VOLD on the 1minute chart there was only 35 red one minute candles all day long. That means of the 390 minutes the market was open only 35 of those minutes was there more selling then buying happening‚Ä¶ Even more incredible on a 5min time frame‚Ä¶ there was NO red candles all day long‚Ä¶ I can not remember a day this year where we did not see no red 5min VOLD candles I actually don‚Äôt even know if that happened in 2022‚Ä¶

If we objectively look at the supply/ demand chart what are we seeing? We see a VERY clear defined range from 404.3 to 417.03‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs exactly a $13 range that we have officially traded within since March 31st‚Ä¶ 

Today we did establish as I was suspecting a new demand at 405.06 just over that 404.03 demand‚Ä¶ this should be come a very strong support area and one that I would be surprised to see broken without a lot of news or data/ volume to support it.

Right now we did not put in a new supply or demand on the weekly time frame. So after establishing 416 supply (resistance) last week we have now come down to retest 411.87 demand (support) and have managed to close over it‚Ä¶ 

As you can see the last 4 weeks of trading have all closed within about a $4 range‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a very tight range.

After what looked like the worlds most convincing sell off beginning we had that very bullish hanging man reversal daily close yesterday. I was afraid that was going to be the end of the sell off and sure enough here we are right back in that 404 to 417 range yet again. This is now our 2nd failed break down bouncing off 404.3 both times. We are coming into this 412-416 area which has become heavy resistance every time we are here‚Ä¶ 

One trend I want to point out is this two days short covering rallies that we have been seeing‚Ä¶ generally speaking we have these back to back days of huge green extreme bull momentum days followed by the 3rd day being a doji/ reversal candle which then leads to a sizeable sell off‚Ä¶ This sets us up almost perfectly for another green day Monday up to that 415-417 area followed by a doji candle then Wednesday CPI comes in hot and we start an aggressive sell off and attempt to finally close under 405 and push to 390.

What truly is incredible about the weekly time frame we have now closed 4 weeks in a row within about a $4.3 range. That is some incredible consolidation. 

This is our second week in a row to hard bounce off the weekly 20ema and close with a doji candle‚Ä¶ actually this is our 5th weekly doji candle in a row‚Ä¶ 7 out of the last 8 weekly candles have actually been dojis‚Ä¶ 

These massive downside wicks on the weekly do make me feel far more bullish than the daily does. I actually do see a scenario here on the weekly where we could push to 428 EOW‚Ä¶ If we get a good CPI print I would be shocked not to close over 428 EOW‚Ä¶ however, if we get a bad CPI print I would be looking for 390-395 EOW.

We once again failed to take out 4040 and 4055 daily supplies this week‚Ä¶ this still gives me indication that eventually Futures will retrace back down here and we are finding another longer DTE short opportunity on the horizon. 

We now have a new daily demand (support) at 4074 which takes out previous demand at 4085‚Ä¶ our upside targets will be 4190-4198 next week.

We have no changes here to the weekly supply/ demand but we did close below the 4174 supply and still failed to come down to the 4055 weekly supply to take that out. There is potential for a push up to 4174 and 4284 next week‚Ä¶ However, one thing I will say is that futures and spy weekly did NOT attempt to establish a new weekly demand (Support) here‚Ä¶ with that being said‚Ä¶ until that happens any upside should be expected to come back down.

Futures daily did rebound and too retook key 4095 pivot point along with the daily 8/20ema. We now are sitting right on this 4150 mid point of this channel we have been trading in. 

Upside potential give a move to 4190-4200 next week pre CPI. This rising wedge just seems to continue to break and then be recaptured.

Futures weekly has closed in the same 44 point range for a month now‚Ä¶ and closed within a 67 point range for 6 weeks straight now‚Ä¶ we are in some heavy consolidation here‚Ä¶ 

One thing to note here and this has been pretty spot on is that generally post JPM collar roll (quarterly options expiration) we see a trend that holds or 7 weeks and then for 4 weeks we inverse that trend‚Ä¶ currently that trend is up and has been up. Which means potentially in the next week or two we could finally see a top and start a month long sell off‚Ä¶ That would nearly perfectly correlate with CPI tomorrow and a drop into the next FOMC meeting on June 14th‚Ä¶ 

I mean lets paint the picture‚Ä¶ a Monday pump and perhaps Tuesday pump/ doji to put in a new YTD high with a target of that 4300 calls collar‚Ä¶ then we start a huge sell off for four weeks as market panics about CPI, banks, rate hikes, and FOMC‚Ä¶

I am still learning the VIX1D so I wouldn‚Äôt take any trades off of this but something I found intriguing is that it closed out a reversal bullish (which would be upside move on VIX1D and potentially downside on SPY) pattern here.. This is a similar pattern we see on 5/1. We also closed our first futures daily gap. 

I am just interested in seeing how this plays out next week.

I have still been tracking data from VIX1D with closing prices, candles, etc. etc. and so far I have found no organized movement or any sort of edge for trading SPY. Early on the first few days there were some good correlations but not right now. 

&#x200B;

Currently the VIX after that massive move up yesterday gave back all of it and then some‚Ä¶ what took two days to go up took one day to go back down and then some‚Ä¶ That big doji candle yesterday was our hint of this move up today which did correlate with the bullish SPY daily close‚Ä¶ This as I have said before usually is high probability movement. 

Now something to think about as we go into CPI next week‚Ä¶ the VIX is currently sitting at that 17.1 pivot area‚Ä¶ this might be the lowest level the VIX has traded at going into CPI‚Ä¶ something to think about is lets say the VIX is at 15-17 going into CPI‚Ä¶ can the VIX truly unwind that much more from here? In theory yes it could go back to that 11-14 range but that would be extreme in my opinion‚Ä¶

The risk is definitely to a downside sell off not an upside push‚Ä¶ now they could always artificially pump the VIX the next two trading days and then a VIX drop/ SPY rally is more possible.

849,What Percent of the time is Jim Cramer right?,Meme,"‚ÄúJim Cramer is a well-known stock market guru and host of CNBC‚Äôs Mad Money. He makes frequent predictions and recommendations about various stocks and sectors. However, his accuracy rate is not very impressive, according to some studies.
One study by Kiplinger found that Cramer‚Äôs accuracy rate was 47% when judging his written calls in a column for New York magazine1. This means he was right less than half of the time. 

Another study by CBS News found that Cramer made four sell recommendations on what ended up being the four best performers out of 749 stocks in a six-month period2. The probability of being wrong enough to do that was 1 in 35,062.
Of course, Cramer‚Äôs accuracy rate may vary depending on the time frame, the source of data, and the criteria for judging his calls. But based on these studies, it seems that Cramer‚Äôs stock picks are not very reliable or consistent.‚Äù

853,Can anyone explain to me why markets are pricing in a pause or why anyone should be bullish?,Discussion,"I'm going to list off 10 reasons to legitimately be bearish for the markets right now. If you're bullish  and are expecting the fed to pause rates, I would love to hear how and why you think this will work with sticky inflation.

I think I can say this for many others here, but nobody seems to understand why it's yolo season. So here are 10 reasons to bearish:

&#x200B;

1. *The 10 year is still dropping while markets go up.* What kind of psycho shit is that? For the record, the **bond market is king**. Every time we've come across a financial crisis of some kind, the bond market always pings problems and problems happen. It's like the Babe Ruth of forecasting shit breaking.
2. *Inflation is sticky. How exactly can you pause rate hikes when inflation is sticky without inflation going back up? You can't, demand will ramp up again while rates are still low and only make the problem worse. Not only is the fed not going to pause rates, but they're more likely to raise them several more times.*
3. *Higher rates means more problems for banks.* Less and less liquidity for anyone overleveraged in US treasury bonds which for the record, is a TON of banks. This means that banks not only lend less because of this, but because of the looming debt ceiling crisis, money going back into the economy will likely be less which means less deposits for banks. When this happens, deflation happens which is great depression kind of shit.
4. *The fed clearly outlined a recession for 2023.*
5. *US projection to run out of money moved from August to June of this year*. This is because the treasury saw less in taxes this year despite everything it paid the IRS to collect more. Seems like the ultra wealthy pulled off another hat trick again! Knowing how the government works, I wouldn't be surprised if this is the inflated time-line. It's probably mid-May.
6. *There is a massive credit bubble around commercial real estate*. Roughly $1.5 trillion are due for repayment in 2025 and because of inflation and cultural changes around WFH, there's a good chance major banks won't see much of that back. This then furthers their liquidity crisis. If rates doesn't cause them to keel over, this absolutely will.
7. *The rapidly escalating conflict in Ukraine.* This alone is becoming a massive blackhole for US tax payer dollars. Thanks to the individual who leaked the documents covering Ukraine, we now know we're losing the fight. So, not only have we pumped BILLIONS of dollars into the problem, but after this is all said and done, we may not even see that money back if ever. Does the federal government expect the middle class to pick up the tab for this too? Ha, of course they do.
8. *OPEC is cutting off supply to oil* causing oil prices to go up thus making inflation worse.
9. *Demand for housing is absolutely plummeting* which will likely begin effecting the means to increase supply here soon.
10. *Commercial real estate defaults are growing rapidly.*

I find it borderline hysterical to see the market go up when companies are seeing enormous profits still. It's as if retail and institutions can't see how this impacts inflation. Demand for money is still high which is why these companies are all profiting still. If demand is still high, there WILL BE NO PAUSE.

Furthermore, rates were never meant to be low as a normal part of the economy. Rates are meant to be low when it needs to be stimulated. If rates remained low, we'd live in constant inflation. However, if the fed can't stimulate the economy without making inflation worse, how do you expect the fed to handle crisis' that disrupt the flow the economy?

So please, share with us what you know. Nothing about the stock market's sentiment aligns with what I was taught in school regarding economics and finance. If you have a legitimate reason as to why the market is pricing in a pause, especially around sticky inflation and everything else mentioned above, we're all ears. I say this humbly too. I will be asking questions and really investigate how and why markets should be pricing in a pause. If you can help it, providing a source would be nice. Nobody likes a trust me bro source.

&#x200B;

# TLDR:

I want to know why the market is pricing in a pause despite sticky inflation plus the many other elements mentioned above that genuinely require the fed to stimulate the economy. Can't stimulate the economy when inflation is sticky or when rates are low. So, rates need to go up yet, the overall market thinks otherwise.

856,Morning Briefing üåû May 9th 2023,Discussion,"Mornin' - The stock market had a mixed start to the week, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq edging higher on Monday and the Dow closing slightly lower. We'll have a lot to consider today, including speeches from Federal Reserve officials, earnings reports from several major companies, and developments on the debt ceiling. Two important inflation data points will be released later in the week, with the consumer price index due out on Wednesday and the producer price index on Thursday. Several notable companies will report earnings today, including Fox Corp., Nikola, Airbnb, Rivian, Virgin Galactic, and Rocket Lab. Investors will be looking for updates on these companies' businesses and outlooks. The battle over the debt ceiling resumes on today as lawmakers in Washington try to avoid a first-ever sovereign debt default by the United States. Biden is scheduled to meet with the top four lawmakers in Congress to discuss the issue. The Treasury Department has warned that the U.S. could run out of money to pay its bills as soon as June 1. Aramco, Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil giant, reported a 19% decline in first-quarter earnings from a year ago. The decline was due to lower oil prices, which have fallen as the global economy reacts to high inflation and the potential for a slowdown. However, Aramco's profit still beat expectations, coming in at $31.9 billion. The company is planning to expand capacity and its CEO said that the company's ""long-term outlook remains unchanged.""

**Watchlist**

**MARA** - This crypto correlated stock has bottomed around $9.30 over the past couple weeks. Now that we are coming down to test support around this level I believe we could see a move higher.

**RIOT** - Riot is coming down to test support around $10.50 which is where shares have bottomed over the past ten days.

**USOIL** - This oil stock is coming down to support around $70. Buying calls on Usoil seems advantageous due to the effect of the lifting of the debt ceiling. The US has been buying oil around $70 to fill up the strategic reserves, but now since the government is still negotiating a deal on the debt ceiling to fund the government the US can't buy oil. But once this agreement is met the US will surely come in and buy some oil which will be a bullish catalyst for oil and gas.

**AMD** - I'll be looking at calls above the 94.25 trigger and target 96.11, 97.24, and 98.30 based on its ATR. If we do get a pullback tomorrow we may bounce around the 91.48 level.

**Earnings**

**ABNB** - For the first quarter, Airbnb expects revenues between $1.75 billion and $1.82 billion, implying year-over-year growth in the band of 16-21% on a reported basis and 18-23% on an FX neutral basis. Airbnb has been witnessing steady improvements in long-distance and cross-border travel due to relaxed travel restrictions. This is likely to have continued to aid its performance in the first quarter.

**RIVN** - For the first quarter, the consensus estimate for RIVN‚Äôs loss per share has widened by a cent in the past seven days. Its bottom-line estimates imply a decline of 5.59% from the year-ago reported numbers.

857,How to play tonight's AAPL Earnings safely,DD,"Apple (AAPL), the king of the stock market, reports earnings is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter results after close today. Apple stock has not disappointed this year and the sturdiness of Apple‚Äôs returns simply cannot be understated. The stock is up 30% YTD, 300% over the last five years, and **1100% over the last 10 years**. It isn‚Äôt flawless though, as it was down -30% during 2022. However, it has nearly earned it all back in the first four months of 2023. 

As the world‚Äôs leading consumer products and technology company, Apple‚Äôs earnings act as an important forerunner for the broader economy. What should we expect from Tim Apple? 

Here‚Äôs what analysts think:

* Earnings: $1.43 per share, according to [Refinitiv](https://www.refinitiv.com/)

* Revenue: $92.96 billion, according to Refinitiv

Revenue is expected to *decrease* 4.4% from $97.28 billion in the same quarter a year ago. This isn‚Äôt great, but also not terrible. Something I don‚Äôt often see mentioned about Apple is the strong seasonal tendencies of its revenues. [Take note of this chart.](https://i.imgur.com/3JGDWtt.png). In the quarterly revenues, we see revenues regularly explode higher following the holiday season and are then mostly stagnant through the rest of the year. But Q1 2023 sales were below Q1 2022, which shows that there was a YoY slowdown in the most recent holiday season.

Apple prepared investors for a down quarter in January. The company hasn‚Äôt provided formal guidance since 2020, but it gives analysts and investors a number of data points that can be used to roughly estimate its performance.

The information it provided earlier this year suggested that sales would drop for a second straight quarter by roughly 5%. Sales of iPads and Macs are expected to see sharp decreases ‚Äî 12% and 25.4%, respectively ‚Äî and iPhone sales also likely dropped. Analysts polled by [FactSet](https://www.factset.com/) expect annual declines in all of Apple‚Äôs hardware product lines.

The report comes as the PC and smartphone markets are mired in one of the worst slumps in recent years. Electronics sales are down sharply after many consumers bought new PCs and phones during the pandemic and others are tightening their belts because of high inflation or recession worries.

In the first quarter, PC shipments decreased 29%, [according to IDC](https://siliconangle.com/2023/04/10/idc-worldwide-pc-shipments-fell-29-first-quarter/), while smartphone shipments were off 14%.

Apple‚Äôs report wraps up earnings season for tech‚Äôs mega-cap companies, after Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft all issued results last week. All four topped analyst estimates, though growth rates were still muted compared to prior years.

While Apple isn‚Äôt immune to the broader market slowdown, some analysts hope it will show strength and resiliency because it sells premium products and has loyal customers. Refinitiv consensus estimates suggest Apple could guide back to growth. They expect 2% expansion in the third quarter. But others are concerned that revenue will keep falling, suggesting that demand for Apple‚Äôs products is eroding.

Does anyone know Samik Chatterjee, the analyst at JPMorgan? He mentioned in a note this week that the ""eventual outcome might be simply driven by F3Q guidance, where investors might be looking for assurance and visibility into limited downside despite a tough macro.‚Äù See, if Apple‚Äôs outlook suggests a year-over-year decline that‚Äôs less than 5%, Apple could still ‚Äútriumph‚Äù on fundamentals, at least according to Chatterjee.

Along with earnings, Apple is also likely to update investors on its [capital return authorization](https://fortune.com/2023/04/17/how-much-will-apple-spend-on-stock-buybacks-earnings-90-billion/). Analysts expect the iPhone maker to announce plans to spend as much as $90 billion on share repurchases and dividends.

**What about the Technicals?**

There isn‚Äôt a clean chart pattern to trade AAPL from, [but this large range looks significant](https://i.imgur.com/xcIhkg0.png). The $180 level is resistance and $130 support. Right now, price is in no-mans land in the middle of this large range.

If price can clear the $180 level, resistance should turn into support, and the next multi-year leg higher in Apple should commence. However, a rejection at $180 would be very significant. If the stock can‚Äôt clear that level, it may be indicative of not just Apple, but the market more broadly.

With a recession likely coming later this year, it is possible we will see Apple retest the high of the range, and then as the recession takes hold, swing back down to the bottom of the range. Rather than trying to short the stock, investors would be better off waiting for price to come back down to the $130-$140 buy zone.

**Valuation??**

The price of Apple is currently 28 times its one-year forward profits, which is higher than both the market average and its five-year median price of 24 times. Despite being one of the most respected companies in the world, this valuation is neither particularly high nor low. The bears don't have a good time with this fair assessment.

**What to do for Earnings?**

Apple is a juggernaut in the stock market, and its supremacy is undeniable. Apple brought luxury to the masses, so if the average person begins to feel the heat of a slowing economy, they probably won‚Äôt be buying a new iPhone. Does this mean puts for earnings? We know the stock moves on average 5 ¬± 3% with earnings. However last quarter, it moved +7%, the one before it was +9% and the one before it was +6%. Wait, so calls? I'm thinking a strangle. I'm going to bet that while it moves on average 5%, it's going to move more, without attempting to predict whether it's going up or down. So I'll be buying AAPL 5/5 160p (at 138 bucks) and 170c (at 150 bucks). This means you can get the strangle for $288. The stock would have to move 4.6% up or 5.1% down to break even. Mind you, this post is not financial or investment advice - consider it as just me offering some education based on what analysts tend to look for in a company when it's time to make a last minute earnings prediction. In fact, just because I'm posting it, AAPL might just stay flat.",2023-05-04 18:55:29,70,"such OTM strangles in inflated IV environment just gives MM more free money.

I did NOT play a position on Netflix (I have a pretty hard set rule NOT to trade earnings‚Ä¶) but I would have eyed some 310 puts on Netflix‚Ä¶ as of right now that would have paid out impressively well.. See how this holds in the morning.

Tesla is expecting a 6.4% move per IV for tomorrow and actually interestingly enough their EPS is predicted to be fairly low compared to the last few earnings only predicting us to be 0.85. I still do not recommend any earnings plays but I am putting out the information for others.

I don‚Äôt usually include tesla but including it today for a freebie as many have requested it return‚Ä¶ its not staying but since earnings are tomorrow lets talk about it‚Ä¶

Weekly wise we have been holding this red channel of 166.94 to 208 since the week of January 23rd and we have now formed a massive breakout/ breakdown triangle‚Ä¶ one could actually infer that this triangle is a massive bear flag too‚Ä¶ Now if we see Tesla break below 181.3 by EOW then we are breaking that support and I would see that as a fairly tempting short play and honestly a closure under 166.94 would be further confirmation of downside‚Ä¶ I would start to target 150.1 and 133.26.

However, IF earnings come in good and we get an upside pump then key resistance is 203.08 followed by confirmation at 208 EOW. For me I actually would be fairly tempted to play a 30-60dte call or put in the direction of Tesla post earnings‚Ä¶ 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Interesting day today‚Ä¶ we FINALLY got a new supply put in. With a new supply put in at 414.1 (just below previous 414.13 supply) we now start to target 411.04 and 409.73 supplies. However, this is where we are once again in a weird pattern here.. we established a new supply which should generally be seen a resistance‚Ä¶ however the way today opened and moved actually put the supply in lower than todays close which actually makes this a support area to watch‚Ä¶ This is where things get complicated and we have to be careful‚Ä¶ 

While a new supply means we look to retest lower supplies and target previous demand (support) which currently is 411.04 -> 409.73 and 409.18‚Ä¶ when market is imbalanced like this we could actually bounce form here and attempt to immediately turn this 414.13 supply into a demand (support) which would be extremely bullish‚Ä¶ Turning a supply into demand or a demand into supply is an extremely strong move. 

Spy is still in extreme bull momentum and the daily chart still is setting up for reversal conditions‚Ä¶ however they are not quite perfect just yet‚Ä¶. Daily 8ema should still attempt to hold as support‚Ä¶ if and when we lose that daily 8ema is when it will be time to look out below‚Ä¶

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

The price action here on spy daily actually perfectly held the resistance line of that red rising wedge at 415.7 however, once again we had a bigger bounce off the low with no bearish continuation and that led to this lower end wick‚Ä¶ 

The rising wedge continues to come to a tighter point here which very well could come to an end tomorrow‚Ä¶ generally speaking rising wedges are bearish reversal patterns and when formed with this cup and handle potentially here on the daily‚Ä¶ we are looking at a hard top with a bigger drop possible‚Ä¶ 

Key support is 413.9 tomorrow and resistance at 415.9.

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 414.1 -> 415.4 -> 417  
 Demand- 409.2  
 Support- 414.1 -> 412.4 -> 409.6  
 Resistance- 415.6 -> 416.9 -> 419.6

Today we also saw a new supply put in on futures daily at 4178‚Ä¶ this is a major level to watch as this is a resistance level that dates back to February. 

Now with this new supply here and being that futures is far more balanced than SPY daily (another reason I like watching both) this shows that we could easily see a retest of 4160 and possible 4154 support (previous supplies) tomorrow or later this week. Our target here should be previous demand at 4116 if we can break through those 4160/4154 levels.

Like I mentioned 4178 is a major level and you can see yesterdays rejection there was a major rejection for the 3rd time (With a candle body). Now interestingly enough we did pump over night and touched 4198 and nearly perfectly rejected it‚Ä¶ not only that but we now have formed a rising wedge inside of the rising wedge. 

Currently blue rising wedge support sits at 4160 for tomorrow (which is a supply level) and resistance sits at 4200 and then 4218. 

The one thing that is clear as we have tested this 414+ area and 4160+ area is that we have come into some heavy resistance. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4154 -> 4160 -> 4178 -> 4198  
 Demand- 4116  
 Support- 4152 -> 4139  
 Resistance- 4200 -> 4236

I continue to remain impressed that the VIX goes lower and lower‚Ä¶ 

The VIX, formally known as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index, measures how much volatility professional investors think the S&P 500 index will experience over the next 30 days. Market professionals refer to this as ‚Äúimplied volatility‚Äù‚Äîimplied because the VIX tracks the options market, where traders make bets about the future performance of different securities and market indices, such as the S&P 500.

Above is a reminder of exactly what the VIX is‚Ä¶ now lets talk about this for a second‚Ä¶

Over 40% of all S&P-related options are now same day expiry (Source: Optionmetrics), or ‚Äúzero-day-to-expiry‚Äù options, shorthanded as ‚Äú0DTE‚Äù. Ten years ago this number was about 5-10%. The daily volume of 0DTE contracts on the S&P 500 (SPX) increased from around 400,000 in January 2022 to approximately 1.2 million in March 2023, representing a three-fold increase in daily volume, according to data from OptionMetrics.

Well this is just my opinion and gonna be a bit of a tin foil hat/ rant moment‚Ä¶ We are starting to see days where the VIX is red (dropping) and Spy is red‚Ä¶ and we are also seeing a lot of times now where SPY is going on a sell off only to see a huge EOD recovery‚Ä¶ 

What is causing this and why are we getting tiny movement and no continuation? 

My opinion here is that we are seeing a few things happening‚Ä¶ with this massive spike of 0dte options big money is playing options intraday and they are getting their instant hit and then through the rest of the day taking that OI off the boards and often times causing huge recoveries when they do so‚Ä¶ 

Why are we not seeing continuation? Well the underlying VIX is not rising‚Ä¶ why? Well no one is going short with long DTE‚Ä¶ everyone is trading 0dte or similar net short positions‚Ä¶ there is no more of these longer DTE contracts that take a week or two to play out‚Ä¶ but according to many articles and analysts‚Ä¶ big money is the most net short since 2011 and 2018 (depends on the article)‚Ä¶ but how could the VIX be in the 16s which by all means is a bull market level? 

Well this is my thoughts‚Ä¶ Markets are pretty much being set up to get slaughtered here soon. Why? Well what is happening is that markets once again do not believe jpow‚Ä¶ they believe we are getting 100bps of rate cuts by EOY‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs not going to happen (as of now according to JPOW)‚Ä¶ markets are ‚Äúforward looking‚Äù but there is a lot to be said that they are too forward looking right now‚Ä¶ plus we know historically its time to sell the last rate hike‚Ä¶ Now if that was last meeting (if jpow changes his tune) but most likely that will be this May 3rd meeting‚Ä¶ IF that is the last rate hike (if JPOW hard hints at this) then we are likely seeing a top on SPY and we are going to start to see some heavy downside‚Ä¶ 

Now much like a month ago in march when we had the Bank run‚Ä¶ we had huge spikes in the VIX‚Ä¶ why? Well markets FINALLY thought there was a reason to not only sell‚Ä¶ but to continue to sell as they thought we were apart of the next great financial crisis (we may still be)‚Ä¶ however, quickly the VIX would dump‚Ä¶ why? Well markets no longer believed that was the case which has led to this rally‚Ä¶

Honestly we are in for some pretty serious pain for the next 2 weeks unless earnings severely tank the markets. Now if earnings come in bad and give bad guidance (or recession hints) we might start to see the VIX push back up leading into FOMC‚Ä¶ but I think we might be in some pain sitting in this 400-420 area for the next few weeks until FOMC and CPI‚Ä¶ Markets need a reason to sell off and to continue to sell off and they just have not had that reason yet‚Ä¶ 

0dte options has forever changed the game.

Well I did experiment with some 1dte SPX today and so far I don‚Äôt hate it‚Ä¶ I will continue to monitor this over the next week or so and see if I want to stick with 1dte or go back to 2dte SPY‚Ä¶ The biggest thing I did notice today though was that mid day consolidation that the 1dte premiums got ate up extremely fast and often times led to being correct on the move and direction but finding ourselves losing value as the play moved in our direction.",2023-04-18 20:58:27,69,"I am a bot.

863,Stormy Waters: Technical Analysis Reveals Bearish Patterns in the Banking Sector,DD,"[Impact of the Banking Crisis, Recession Fears, High Valuations, and Interest Rate Hikes on Banks' Price Action](https://www.savefortuna.com/post/stormy-waters-technical-analysis-reveals-bearish-patterns-in-the-banking-sector)

The banking sector is currently facing a number of challenges, including the risk of recession, high valuations, interest rate hikes, and fears of inflation. These challenges are reflected in the price action of many banks, which are currently expressing bearish patterns.

Technical analysis of multiple banks reveals that many are currently presenting bearish patterns such as head and shoulders, double tops, and ascending channels.

>‚ÄúThe stock market is a device to transfer money from the impatient to the patient.‚Äù - Warren Buffett

A Sector In Crisis

One factor contributing to the bearish sentiment in the banking sector is the ongoing banking crisis, which has been brought on by multiple bank failures and concerns about the stability of the financial system. This crisis has led to increased regulatory scrutiny and tighter lending standards, which are putting pressure on banks' profitability and growth prospects.

Additionally, fears of a recession are also weighing on the banking sector. A recession would likely lead to increased loan defaults and reduced demand for banking services, which could further erode banks' earnings and asset quality.

High valuations are another headwind for the banking sector. Many banks are currently trading at relatively high price-to-earnings ratios, which suggests that investors have high expectations for future earnings growth. However, if earnings fail to meet these expectations, investors may begin to sell off bank stocks, leading to further declines in price.

Finally, interest rate hikes are also a challenge for banks. Higher interest rates can lead to increased borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, which can reduce demand for loans and other banking services. Additionally, higher rates can also put pressure on banks' net interest margins, which can reduce their profitability.

Technical Analysis

It all started with an article on [Morgan Stanley](https://www.morganstanley.com/)

. As usual, I was curious to see what kind of trajectory their stock was on. With a tendency of being contrarian, and Q1 bank earnings coming up, I decided to do an analysis of some of the major banks to see how they may be affected by the current banking crisis. Usually, I expect price action to be in line with major data points and headlines, in the hopes of finding discrepancies. It is these discrepancies that highlight opportunities in markets. What kind of discrepancies do we look for?

1. Fundamental Discrepancies: Traders might look for discrepancies between the fundamental analysis of a company and its current market valuation. For example, if a company's fundamentals suggest that it is undervalued but its stock price is declining, this could be an opportunity for traders to buy the stock.
2. Market Condition Discrepancies: Traders might look for discrepancies between the current market conditions and the direction of a stock's price. For example, if the market is bullish but a stock's price is declining, this could be an opportunity for traders to buy the stock, expecting it to rebound as the market recovers.
3. Technical Analysis Discrepancies: Traders might look for discrepancies between the technical analysis of a stock's price chart and its current market valuation. For example, if a stock's price chart shows a bullish trend but its current market valuation

So What Do We See?

[**Morgan Stanley**](https://www.morganstanley.com/)

https://preview.redd.it/07ng3flynfua1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=70a2bb323e99c989dc91cc008b5ef1c265d1d371

An ""**M top**"" is a bearish chart pattern that occurs in technical analysis. It is characterized by two peaks that form a letter ""M"" shape on a price chart. The pattern occurs when a stock or asset price reaches a high point, then pulls back to a support level before rising again to a similar high point. However, instead of breaking through this resistance level, the price falls sharply, creating an ""M"" shape on the chart.

A ""**break** of a trendline"" occurs when the price of an asset moves below or above the trendline, indicating a potential reversal in the trend. A break of a trendline can be significant because it can signal a shift in market sentiment, with buyers or sellers gaining control of the market. For example, if a stock has been in an uptrend and then breaks below its trendline, this could indicate that the buying pressure has decreased, and the stock price may start to fall. Conversely, if a stock has been in a downtrend and then breaks above its trendline, this could signal a reversal in the trend and a potential buying opportunity.

An ""**ascending channel""** consists of two parallel trend lines, with the upper trend line connecting the highs and the lower trend line connecting the lows. The upper trend line acts as resistance, while the lower trend line acts as support. As long as the price stays within the channel, it is said to be in an uptrend.

If the price of an asset breaks below the lower border of an ascending channel, it can indicate a potential trend reversal. A break below the lower border can be seen as a sign of weakness in the uptrend and could signal a shift in market sentiment toward bearishness.

[**JP Morgan Chase & Co.**](https://www.jpmorgan.com/)

In technical analysis, a **head and shoulders** pattern is a bearish reversal pattern that occurs on a price chart. It is formed when a stock or asset price rises to a peak, then declines to a support level before rising again to a higher peak (the ""left shoulder""). The price then declines again to the same support level before rising once more to a higher peak (the ""head""). Finally, the price declines again to the support level before rising once more to a lower peak (the ""right shoulder"").

The head and shoulders pattern is significant because it indicates that the bulls (buyers) have failed to push the price higher, and the bears (sellers) have gained control of the market. When the price falls below the support level, it confirms the pattern and signals a potential reversal in the trend. Other bearish signals that can be seen (described above) in the chart are an ascending channel (bearish) and two trendline breaks (Bearish when the trendline is broken to the downside). Third time's the charm?

Technical patterns (Ascending channel and M formation, both bearish) have already been described above.

Technicals include bearish ascending channels with trendline breaks. There is even a faint head and shoulders pattern at the end of the most recent price action.

Conclusion

In conclusion, technical analysis of multiple banks suggests that the banking sector is currently facing significant headwinds, including the ongoing banking crisis, fears of a recession, high valuations, and interest rate hikes. There has also been a recent slowdown in lending due to the recent credit crunch, which you can read about in my previous [post](https://www.savefortuna.com/post/top-5-items-under-20-i-can-not-live-without)

871,The Basics of Options: Part One of However Many of These I Decide to Make,Discussion,"Okay. There are no emojis in this post. Leave now if you want emojis. There will, however, be useful market ideas, which are the emojis of intelligence. 

.

I used to frequent this place a few years ago, and it appears some of the basics have been lost. And though I am not currently drunk enough to handle the questions this post will generate, I plan to rectify that before I take any questions. So buckle in, and here is an explanation of what options are, how they work, and some very, very basic information about ""the greeks"" that govern them.

.

Okay, so you're young, dumb, and full of Wendy's at the employee discount, and you want 100 shares of Google. Well, you can't have 100 shares of Google, because those are for customers of Wendy's that can afford the Dave's triple. But you can pretend you own 100 shares of Google, for a little while. You can basically rent them.

.

An Option is an agreement that by a certain time (the option expiry date), you will either sell them 100 shares at a given price (this is called a put), or buy 100 shares at a given price (this is called a call). You don't have to fulfill the agreement, but they have to honor it if you exercise the option, then, or at any time before then. You paid for the option, so it's yours to exercise, sell, or let expire.

.

Options have value if you are certain the price will go up or down, because you are extremely savvy at market dynamics, or more realistically because your dog shit in the back corner of your yard and you believe that makes the market go up, you can have much larger leverage to profit from the price change. If the price of a stock goes up $1, you gain $1. But if you have an option on that stock, the gain is $100 ($1 each on the 100 in the option). If you buy an option one dollar ""out of the money"" (above the current price), the price will have to go up $2 for you to gain that $1, but the option will be cheaper, because the price will have to go up a dollar before your options is even ""in the money"" (the price of the stock is above your purchase strike price). People sell it to you cheaper, because they are less at risk of you exercising the option.

.

So it's Monday, and your dog shit in the corner, and you think Google will go up. You buy a call option expiring Friday a dollar out of the money. The prices goes up $3 by Friday. The raw value of the option is $2 over your strike price, so $200 in your pocket, if options were just based on the strike. Naturally, there's more to it than that.

.

Unfortunately, people know you are going to watch your dog's rectal prognostication, so they don't just charge you a flat fee for these options.

.

Options are prices on a number of factors. Those are called the Greeks, not only because they are represented by Greek letters, but also because they will probably lead to austerity measures in your lifestyle after you spend all your money on options. The first big greek you will learn to hate is Theta. You get charged for the **time** you have for the price to go up. 

.

Theta is costly further out, but people want to be paid for having their 100 shares tied up while you feed your dog Alpo. Theta decays over time, slowly at first and then quickly on the last day (the ""zero day's to expiry"" day... 0dte). On the last day, you burn about half a dollar of theta from open till noon on a strike close to the price. So fifty dollars gone while you wait for the price to move. You get used to it, but it sucks.

.

There is one more greek I want to talk about right now, because it will become more important later: Delta. Delta can be thought of as the percent of the 100 shares that can be thought of as in the money. If your Delta is .45, it's like 45 of your 100 shares are in profit. at 4 pm on Friday, that's what your value is if it's a fraction, because that's the value of your option over the strike. If your option is under the strike at close of business, the delta is **Zero**. And you have nothing, but the dog shit in your yard to clean up.

.

You have PACW last night publicly declaring literally hours after JPOW said the banks were strong and sound that it was infact not strong and sound. And that they were weighing their options‚Ä¶ The market absolutely did not handle that news well. 

Amazingly the market continued to still buy the dip throughout the night. Then what happens? The Financial Times puts out a piece that it has hired advisors to explore its options‚Ä¶ now the true question is how does something like this get made up? Or is it? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lvmmntgcxvxa1.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=20ab761bae65bb3a03085177af7c7417eb6bbda6

Lets think about this logistically‚Ä¶ is a major media source like the financial times who is the worlds largest circulation fund group out there really going to put out a fake article? Would a company like them REALLY risk their status and credibility doing that? 

No I don‚Äôt think they would‚Ä¶ so this is my thoughts‚Ä¶ PACW is going to go under next as we saw last night after hours with the hit piece‚Ä¶ now WAL is probably the next one to go down‚Ä¶ perhaps it was meant to be released after hours today and the article got pushed too quickly‚Ä¶ or perhaps the source leaked the info quicker than they were supposed to‚Ä¶ we will never know the truth‚Ä¶

There are two ways to look at this‚Ä¶ WAL is truly on the brink of collapse and are clinging to life with saying it was false or two that was a VERY purposefully released statement to cause panic and then they retracted it to save the market‚Ä¶ Whether its right or not think about how much more easily that news will be digested when it actually comes true‚Ä¶ Buy the rumor and sell the news‚Ä¶ 

I truly don‚Äôt think we have seen the last of these banks collapsing.

**APPLE EARNINGS**

Im actually a little surprised as of writing this and the conference call starting at 5pm that Apple is only up 1%... that‚Äôs pretty underwhelming move for Apple as I believe about a 3.5% move was expected‚Ä¶ 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/syft5midxvxa1.png?width=911&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=511d38858d156547ab9f1ffff4cd97a4f3ac931f

Now we did not make any changes to supply/ demand today but we did come down and bounce pretty nicely off that 404.3 demand area and closed over it. There is a very real scenario here where we actually could find ourselves bouncing green tomorrow back to that 410 area which would likely established this 405.13 area as a new demand (support). If that happens then I would actually look for a rally into CPI next week back to that 415-417 area. 

However, if with the lackluster Apple move after hours and most importantly Unemployment rate in the morning‚Ä¶ takes us down then we could look for a closure under 404.3 tomorrow which then once again opens up a move to 399.07. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

On SPY daily here we DID finally close back under 405.2 support and more importantly we did break that rising wedge on the daily timeframe once again‚Ä¶ Now this has happened once before last week and that led to an immediate bounce back to 415-417 area. 

I actually tend to favor a bullish move from here‚Ä¶ We didn‚Äôt close out In my opinion a very bearish continuation candle. This is more of a dragonfly doji/ hanging man candle close which would more likely than not result in a push back up tomorrow not down. 

Bear case- we closed a full candle below the daily 8/20ema and actually closed below the daily 50ema for the first time since March 28th. We closed under 405.2 which is a major pivot point. We broke through a major support of the daily rising wedge. Daily IV and price action represent a bearish movement not bullish. 

Bull case- we did close that hanging man bullish reversal pattern today. With 404.3 demand being a nice support bounce here and seemingly the banking issues being over for now‚Ä¶ without further fuel for the sell off realistically this could see a reversal back to the upside.

From a weekly stand point here‚Ä¶ bears NEED a closure under 407.3 minimally but ideally under 402.5 EOD tomorrow‚Ä¶ Bulls NEED a closure minimally back over 407.3 but realistically back over 411.6.

A slightly different story on Futures here‚Ä¶ so what im seeing is that we did end up losing 4085 demand (support) and actually are turning it into resistance now‚Ä¶ We can within 7 points of that 4055 supply target I have been so longly waiting for‚Ä¶ 

Now a few major differences here on Futures is that we have no put in 5 out of the last 6 days as ‚Äúhigh volatility‚Äù candles‚Ä¶ this in simple terms means that there is MAJOR fights in price action going on‚Ä¶ in very simple terms‚Ä¶ low volatility means that one side is sitting out (as in buyers easily are winning) and high volatility means that there is a high level of movement on buyers and sellers to get whatever direction we have‚Ä¶ Why does this matter? Well it matters because the last time we had this many high volatility candles in this short period of time was the March bottom‚Ä¶ now keep in mind high volatility usually signifies and end of a trend‚Ä¶ what would you say the longer term trend has been? That would be bullish‚Ä¶ so if that is changing well‚Ä¶ we may be seeing the top then‚Ä¶. Now mind you this will never predict the timing of it and a daily timeframe can take a while to pray out‚Ä¶

Now on futures as I had mentioned yesterday we had lost the daily rising wedge support which signified that we should have seen the red day like we did get today. However, the daily candle structure remains notably different and is very important in its difference‚Ä¶

The daily futures candles is actually a gravestone doji‚Ä¶ now this is where you have to know price action to see the difference here‚Ä¶ many people assume that any sort of doji signifies an immediate reversal‚Ä¶ however, that does not actually always happen. More times than not I would say a downtrend with a gravestone doji actually results in a continuation pattern. 

Few things to note here‚Ä¶ this is actually SPY and Futures fourth red day in a row‚Ä¶ that has not occurred since December 14th to 19th‚Ä¶ I would be a little surprised to see a 5th red day in a row but from a macro news stand point of the banking issues I could see it happening‚Ä¶ 

This doji candle today did come up and retest the daily 8/20ema and hard reject is and in addition to that we also have our first 8/20ema bearish crossover since February. Which if you remember started a nice 8% sell off on SPY.

From a weekly stand point on futures‚Ä¶ Bears NEED a closure under 4055 ideally but minimally under 4095‚Ä¶ bulls NEED a closure over 4095 minimally but ideally over 4110.

We did not quite get the 20-30% VIX reaction I was expecting though we were up around 20% at the peak of the WAL news‚Ä¶ We are seeing two more rising wedges broken here and riding in a bull channel up now too‚Ä¶ The question remains is there enough news to push the VIX higher or much like April is this 20.1 level where the fear dies? 

One big difference I see here is that the FG index is much much lower than last time the VIX was at these levels‚Ä¶ with the FG index at 50‚Ä¶ we have room to truly go either way.

Overall a good day of profits‚Ä¶ This week right now im sitting just under 2x my weekly goal‚Ä¶ one of my best weeks of trading this year‚Ä¶ actually as of now this is my 2nd most profitable week of trading this year‚Ä¶ If I am able to put in another good trading day tomorrow (profitable) I will be able to turn in my most profitable week of the year‚Ä¶

We still find ourselves in this same range and we have not been able to breakout of it for over a month now‚Ä¶ 

We still are imbalanced for now as we are closed over the previous established supply without making a new demand‚Ä¶ currently the way price action reads is that if we are able to establish a higher closer tomorrow we actually could establish a new demand (support). However, honestly right now we are in the chop zone and there is absolutely no direction and i feel fairly confident when I say if anyone is playing a long or short then its just a guess‚Ä¶ 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

On SPY daily we actually have two major patterns to watch‚Ä¶ the first is the black diamond pattern and the second pattern is this blue breakout/ down triangle. As of right now key support tomorrow is 411.24 and key resistance is 413.7. If one of these levels breaks we could be eyeing a much bigger move in that direction atleast until the diamond support/ resistance is tested and broken. 

As of right now we are riding the support of the daily 8ema which should and could allow for further continuation to the upside‚Ä¶ but as you can see much like intraday now we just are finding new ranges to trade within and we have no continuation to the upside or downside. 

From a weekly stand point of view‚Ä¶ bears want a minimum close under 411.87 but really under 409.5 (weekly 8ema), however, bulls would prosper most with a closure over 416 minimum. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 411.1 -> 415.6  
 Demand- 405

Pretty similar story here on futures as we are now wedged right between the 4153 supply and 4135 demand. Favoritism would go for a new supply to be confirmed and possibly if we get a bigger red day tomorrow we could re-establish 4153 as supply (resistance) which would be extremely bearish‚Ä¶ 

However, if we break out tomorrow there is a chance we could push up to the 4190/4198 supply area and attempt to establish a new higher supply before coming back down. 

Currently we are in the process of finding the next supply (resistance).

Futures also turned its 4th doji in a row in today‚Ä¶ however, we have a slightly different structure with a rising wedge but inside of that we are eyeing a real nice breakout/ down triangle. 

Key support is 4134 and key resistance is 4165. Whichever one of these targets is broken we should expect a continuation of that into next week. As of right now there is a pretty equal weighted case of dumping through 4134 and breakout through 4165. The technicals really do support both. This double bottom off 4134 with a follow up double top off 4153 would give me a bearish bias for tomorrow. However, this 4134 and 4153 levels are both extremely strong and important. 

From a weekly stand point the bulls want to see this close minimally over 4192, however, bears would be cheering for joy with a closure under 4137 but ideally under 4128. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4153 -> 4190

 Support- 4134 -> 4110

The VIX continues to fight right about this 16.96 (call it 17) area and that has been a major support area for the last 4 trading days, however, we have now attempted to turn that into resistance. If this is the VIX turning 17 into resistance then the favoritism would be to the downside not the upside here for VIX which would give a bullish push up to SPY. 

I am not too worried about the white falling wedge as that is not a super strong line yet‚Ä¶ however, this red support line which makes a real nice breakout triangle for this blue falling wedge is one to watch‚Ä¶ that support lies at 16.65 tomorrow‚Ä¶ IF we lose that support then I would see this as a bear flag for the VIX which means the VIX likely heads back to the 15s next week and SPY up to the 415-420 area.

Now if you have been following my posts for a while you know the one thing I am watching for is tech to sell off‚Ä¶ why? Because every single sell off for really the last 2-3 weeks has been led by the tickers in SPY/ DOW not by the NASD‚Ä¶ so until tech finally shows weakness‚Ä¶ we are stuck in this trend‚Ä¶ one of the biggest things I am looking for is the breakout strength recovery of the DXY‚Ä¶ as of today we FINALLY broke this two month long falling wedge‚Ä¶ now this might be a failed breakout‚Ä¶ however, as you can see by the curling upward EMAs.. this is looking like a heavy consolidation before a move to the upside‚Ä¶ I will be watching for a move over and closing over the 102.196 area‚Ä¶ IF and when that closure happens that should signal a breakage of the consolidation and move to the upside‚Ä¶

DXY regaining strength finally should take tech down finally‚Ä¶ 

We might into next week see TECH start its sell off‚Ä¶ 

The 10YR yield has not quite recovered yet and continues to show weakness and is just basing in this 3.306% to 3.607% area.

Add-on: it seems that the broker changed their liquidity provider - fx CFD's been closed for 1h during rollover today and opened along futures - before they closed for a minute only

Looks more and more likely the broker itself was not the issue, but something on the liquidity pool side. So either the provider itself or, most likely, a bigger client on the pool side

899,Novavax (NXAX) Due Diligence: Fire in the hole!,DD,"Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor nor am I holding myself out to be one. The following is my assessment of publicly available data. I‚Äôm simply sharing my thoughts and hold a bearish position.

**I expect Novavax (NVAX) to plunge Tuesday AM after they announce earnings.**

Drivers for my bearish sentiment:

\- Their primary 2023 objective is to provide a sufficient covid candidate for the western hemisphere fall season. Their longer process compared to MRNA does not give them an opportunity to play in the USA fall season.

\- NVAX requires 6 months to create a new variant. Since the January VRPACK, they have informed the FDA of the need to select a new variant as soon as possible but that still hasn‚Äôt happened.

\- 82% of annual flu vaccinations occur in September and October.

\- Based on last season‚Äôs CDC data and surveys, more people are expected to get a flu shot in 2023 than a covid shot. Healthcare professionals are therefore indicating a preference to offer a covid shot when a patient comes in for a flu shot. (NVAX will likely not be an option in Sep & Oct)

\- They had previously overestimated the size of the global covid market. They will have to for the first time provide 2023 guidance which should reflect a very small market share and no projected sales of non covid products.

\- The pandemic has ended, EUA labeled vaccines are not acceptable though NVAX claims otherwise. We haven‚Äôt yet seen the FDA exception.

\- The above is critical because NVAX does not have full authorization (BLA) for it‚Äôs covid vaccine.

\- Their financial stability is questionable as confirmed by the CEO in the last earnings call.

\- GAVI is still seeking a refund of the $700M Advance Purchase Agreement

\- The covid vaccine market is surprisingly differentiated by brand. Patients want to know and select the type of vaccine they will get. Few people paid attention to the maker of their flu shot but that is not the case for Covid. This doesn‚Äôt bode well for NVAX.

&#x200B;

Upside risks:

\- Positive Covid-Flu combo update

\- Malaria upside

\- Company indicating, they are a buyout target

\- Significantly beating Q1 revenue estimate

\- Providing an overly optimistic 2023 FY guidance with a strong 2H2023 emphasis

\- Better than expected cost cutting

906,Why I'm getting PYPL calls for earnings,DD,"Another major week of earnings around the world and across the market cap spectrum is on the way. Today PayPal (PYPL) kicks things off and will be reporting earnings from the most recent quarter this afternoon. With a solid EPS beat rate history and low valuation, I just had to make a post about it. [Last post was AAPL and it did fairly well](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/137wdc6/how_to_play_tonights_aapl_earnings_safely/). 

PYPL is a global, technology-driven payment platform with hundreds of millions of direct customer relationships in more than 200 countries. It empowers a streamlined digital and mobile payment experience in-browser, on mobile devices, and in-app. PayPal is also accepted at 75%+ of the largest 100 internet retailers. The California-based $85 billion market cap Transaction and Payment Processing Services industry company within the Financials sector trades at a high 12-month GAAP price-to-earnings ratio and does not pay a dividend, according to [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/).

Wall Street analysts expect PayPal will report earnings per share of $1.10 as opposed to earnings of $0.880 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. Analysts also expect sales to increase by 7.69% over the previous year's quarter to $6.98 billion. They expect an average profit of $4.89 per share for the current fiscal year, compared to $4.13 per share in the previous year. On average, analysts predict that the company will report annual sales of $29.38 billion.

**Factors at Play**

PayPal‚Äôs persistent efforts toward strengthening the product portfolio are likely to have aided the company in gaining traction among customers in the first quarter. The company‚Äôs upcoming results are likely to have benefited from Venmo‚Äôs product line strength, which is expected to have continued to aid customer engagement on PayPal‚Äôs platform. This is expected to have boosted growth in total active accounts in the quarter under review. Venmo‚Äôs strong monetization efforts are likely to have aided its adoption rate in the to-be-reported quarter.

Robust PayPal Checkout experiences are expected to have sustained the company‚Äôs momentum in the quarter under review. PayPal is expected to have gained from the growing proliferation of buy now pay later (BNPL) solution on the back of its strong offerings. Further, strengthening offerings for small businesses is likely to have boosted growth in the company‚Äôs payments volume in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.

**Key Metrics to Consider**

Total payment volume (TPV), active customer accounts, payment transactions per active account and the total number of payment transactions are considered to be the key metrics for analyzing PayPal‚Äôs business growth.

For the first quarter, the number of active customer accounts is estimated to be at 438 million, up 2.1% from the year-ago quarter‚Äôs reported figure. The consensus mark for payment transactions per active user is pegged at 52 million, suggesting growth of 10.6% from the year-ago quarter‚Äôs reported number. The consensus estimate for the total number of payment transactions is around 5.8 billion, indicating an improvement of 12.6% from the prior-year quarter‚Äôs reported figure. The estimate floating around for TPV is pegged at $348 billion, suggesting growth of 7.8% on a year-over-year basis.

**But Q1 Results Won't just be a Game of Numbers**

PayPal was one of a host of fintech companies slashing headcounts earlier this year. Layoff announcements have largely rewarded shareholders, but the stock has not caught a major bid over the last several months. The business‚Äôs skew to lower- and middle-income consumers is a risk during this phase of the business cycle. Moreover, increasing competition from payment providers could high ARPU metrics this year ‚Äì that will be a key metric to keep your eye on in the upcoming earnings report.

Amongst some [management changes](https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/02/10/paypal-ceo-to-step-down-good-news-for-investors/), it is key that the next phase of the business‚Äôs growth has a clear focus. Notably, the company's president and CEO Dan Schulman announced his retirement on Dec. 31, but said he will continue to serve on the board. About one month later, there were news on CFO Blake Jorgensen stepping down from his role after a leave of absence for health reasons. Also, PayPal's chief transformation officer and senior vice president of finance and analytics, Erica Gessert, joined the work marketplace Upwork as CFO in April. 

It‚Äôs expected that guidance will only be given one quarter at a time, but a guidance raise would certainly help the share price ‚Äì and I think we could get that based on decent numbers from other firms in the industry.

**Competitive Risks**

PYPL has exposure to how the macro consumer picture evolves. Should a deeper recession take place, then the firm will struggle. Also, I think too much focus on slashing expenses could be a risk to market share - if that mindset cuts into high-ROI initiatives, then its competitors could pounce. I also have apprehension regarding how the new CEO will lead as smaller transaction players grow. What's more, new regulations in the industry could hurt a larger player like PayPal and potentially favor smaller companies with less dominance.

**Peer Comparison**

Relative to its competitors, PYPL is priced with a mid-range valuation. I took a look at Fiserv (FISV), Adyen (OTCPK:ADYEY), Block (SQ), Fidelity National Financial Information Services (FIS), and Global Payments (GPN). Forward operating P/Es range from 9.4 on the low end (FIS) to more than 70 with ADYEY. PYPL's 1.09 PEG is attractive compared to its peers - only GPN has a lower ratio using forward estimates.

But PYPL sports better revenue growth than GPN in the out year, with a better net income margin. PYPL is also the leader in the space with its $85 billion market cap, and market share should be protected should the management team execute well on PayPal's next stage of growth.

**Catalysts**

I'll be looking for what the new CEO has to say on upcoming product developments as it introduces upgrades to Venmo and other digital wallet services. If those come to fruition, then there's a reasonable chance that 2023 EPS guidance of $4.87 could be raised.

What could help support the stock this year is the firm's stock buyback plan. With about $5 billion of net free cash flow in FY23, there's ample room for at least $3 billion.

Another upside catalyst is activism from [Elliott Management](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/30/activist-elliott-snaps-up-an-interest-in-paypal-this-is-what-could-be-next-for-the-payments-giant.html). That pressure could result in further cost-cutting initiatives. In addition to buybacks, a dividend announcement can't be ruled out - I assert that would be viewed positively by the market since the company has plenty of FCF to reward shareholders while still funding growth projects. A new, streamlined PayPal may be needed in this competitive landscape.

**Valuation**

On valuation, analysts at [BofA](https://business.bofa.com/en-us/content/global-research-about.html) see earnings rebounding sharply in 2023 after declines last year. Per-share profits are seen as continuing to rise at a double-digit pace through 2025. The [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/) consensus outlook is about on par with what BofA projects. No dividends are expected to be paid on the stock, but PYPL is solidly free cash flow positive.

https://i.imgur.com/EwPJGOY.png

Using out-year estimates, the earnings multiples are attractive on the stock considering the high growth outlook. What‚Äôs more, the EV/EBITDA ratio is about in line with the market. Overall, if we assign just a 20x forward P/E (a sharp discount to its 37.7 5-year average), then the stock should be near $98. Lastly, the forward PEG ratio is very low at 1.09 compared to the 5-year mean of 1.97.

**Looking at the Options Chain**

Digging into the upcoming earnings report, data from Option Research & Technology Services ([ORATS](https://orats.com/)) show a consensus EPS forecast of $1.10 which would be a strong 25% climb from $0.88 of per-share profits earned in the same period a year ago. ORATS reports that there have been six analyst upgrades of EPS estimates since the February quarterly report. With a strong beat rate history, topping estimates in 11 of the 12 last instances, an earnings beat is likely. But shares have a mixed performance history following earnings dates.

This time around, the options market has priced in a 6.6% earnings-related stock price swing. That is the cheapest straddle dating back to July of 2021. With a lower VIX today, it makes sense. Also, notice small moves in the stock in the previous pair of earnings reactions. Overall, I see the options as fairly priced given these dynamics. So with a strong EPS beat rate history, and with cheaper options, are calls in order?

**The Technicals**

With an attractive valuation and fairly valued options before Monday evening‚Äôs earnings release, the chart is less sanguine. Notice in the graph below that shares are consolidating in a descending triangle pattern. The presumption is that price action will resolve in the trend of larger degree ‚Äì which is lower in this instance. A breakdown under $65 would imply a measured move price objective at an absurdly low level based on the top of the pattern being near $120, so we need a more realistic support bogey.

There is longer-term support in the low to mid-$40s that likely attracts buyers. But a move above $90 would help support the case for a bullish breakout from the pattern. Also, the $81 level represents the flat 200-day moving average (the 40-week moving average is essentially the same thing), so rising above that on a weekly closing basis would be bullish

**What to do for Earnings?**

Paypal moves on average about 7.6 ¬± 5.9% with earnings. Last earnings, it rose about 6%. Could we see another rise like it? If so, a PYPL call spread looks good, grabbing the 5/12 80c for $140 and selling the 85c for $53 (at the time of writing this). This means you can get the spread for $87, this could offer 5.7x gains. Ideally we want the stock to go up to $81-85, an increase of 5.8 to 11.4%. Keep in mind, with earnings you can never predict things with certainty. This post is not financial or investment advice, consider it as just me offering some education based on what analysts tend to look for in a company when it's time to make a last minute earnings prediction. In fact, just because I'm posting it, Paypal might crash. Just as an F you.",2023-05-08 18:10:55,60,I scrolled and scrolled through the gibberish.  Only to post I 10xed pypl puts after earnings.
907,A Tale of Two Traders,Shitpost,"Two traders sat in front of their computer screens, watching the stock market anxiously. One was a bull, who had bought a large position in a promising technology company after conducting extensive research on the company through WSB. After reading several DD‚Äôs containing üöÄ and users saying ‚Äúto the moon‚Äù , he was convinced that the stock price would soar, as did his üçÜ upon the thoughts of the profits he‚Äôd make. The other was a bear, who had shorted the same stock after conducting his own analysis and concluding that the company was overvalued. He thoroughly analyzed the company‚Äôs financial statements and went dumpster diving near the company‚Äôs HQ to obtain an edge. They both speculated , with leveraged positions that conformed to each of their personal risk tolerance. 

The day started off well for the Bull, with the stock trading higher than the previous day's close. The bull felt confident and optimistic, certain that his tendies were secured. On the other hand, the bear was nervous , but convinced that the stock would eventually fall. He believed in the law of gravity, which indicates ‚Äúwhat goes up, must come down‚Äù. 

As the day wore on, the market began to plummet, and the stock in question was no exception. The bull watched in horror as the stock price dropped lower and lower, erasing his gains and putting him in a deep hole. He frantically searched for news that could explain the sudden downturn, but found nothing. 

Meanwhile, the bear watched with a sense of grim satisfaction as his short position began to pay off. He had been right about the company's overvaluation, and he was now poised to make a tidy profit. He held his position steadfastly, convinced that the stock would continue to fall.

As the stock price continued to plummet, the bull turned to the bear and asked if he could close half of his position, hoping to salvage some of his losses.

[Bull: Please, can you just close half of your large position? Your short covering would help cushion this ignominious price action. I can't afford to lose everything.](https://imgur.com/gallery/dnM52Kw)

Bear: No, I'm afraid not. This is how the market behaves, just like in nature. If a deer gets hunted down by a lion, do you think it‚Äôs gonna get a fucking pass? 

Bull: But I did everything right. I did extensive DD on WSB. I diamond handed.

Bear: And I did the same. I conducted my own analysis and came to a different conclusion. That's the nature of the market - there are always bulls and bears, and one side will come out on top.

Bull: But this isn't fair. I saw in a DD by a guy called u/CASH-FLOW that it was a
cutting edge tech firm out of the Midwest, awaiting imminent patent approval on a new generation of radar equipment‚Ä¶ I put in so much effort and now I'm losing everything.

Bear: Fairness has nothing to do with it. The market is driven by supply and demand, by fear and greed. It's a complex system that can't be controlled or predicted.

As the bear spoke, a third trader, a day trader who had been neutral on the stock, watched the conversation from afar. The trader had noticed the intense emotions of both the bull and the bear, and couldn't help but think about the nature of the stock market.

Trader: The stock market is like a wild animal. It may be temporarily tamed, but never completely controlled. It's important to approach it with a sense of detachment, to remember that our emotions can cloud our judgment and lead us astray. Rid yourselves of the illusion that you can predict it or that it‚Äôs supposed to be fair. 

The bull and the bear looked up, surprised to hear a voice from nowhere.

Trader: We may have different opinions and strategies, but we're all subject to the same laws of the market. We must be humble, flexible, and open-minded. That's the only way to survive in this jungle. Even the legends of the old days, ControltheNarrative, Analfarmer2, or 1RonMan‚Ä¶[they met an unsavory, but fair, end.](https://imgur.com/gallery/2RewdB1) The market doesn‚Äôt care about your wants, needs, debts, or dreams‚Ä¶ it just cares about maintaining equilibrium between buyers and sellers. The bull and bear. You and him.

They looked at each other, and for a moment, they saw each other not as adversaries, but as fellow travelers in the same journey. They both have the same end goal: hella tendies. Just different ways of getting there. They nodded to the trader in the sky, and turned back to their screens, ready to face the challenges of the market once again.",2023-04-30 17:17:22,59,Why would someone waste the time and energy to write this?

911,What's next for the dollar?,Discussion,"The  outlook for the USD hinges less on the Fed and more on market  expectations regarding the regulator's moves. Weak macroeconomic  indicators and the threat of a recession, for instance, suggest a  possible revision of monetary policy.

On  the other hand, robust corporate earnings leave room for maneuver. In  simpler terms, better data has a tendency to delay any changes in the  Fed's tone. This is why USD and government bond yields surged on Friday.

Regarding  the prospects of a recession, the fact that truck traffic on China's  domestic highways is down 8% (W/W) and the U.S. anticipates a 2% drop in  demand by 2023 implies that deflation could accelerate even without the  Fed's assistance.

For more  insights, we need to rely on macroeconomic data. The Beige Book,  reflecting the regulator's assessment of the nation's current economic  situation, will be released on Wednesday. Additionally, Fed officials  Williams, Waller, Bowman, and Bostic are scheduled to give speeches  throughout the week.

Lastly, U.S.  budget negotiations could prompt further declines in the dollar.

912,Welcome to the chop zone‚Ä¶ 5-8-23 SPY/ ES Futures and VIX Daily Market Analysis,DD,"Well I had assumed after Fridays huge push up that we would see continuation today followed by a doji/ consolidation day tomorrow. However, the consolidation and extreme chop came today. Today managed to only put in a full $1.96 of range on SPY or about 40% of the 10day average range‚Ä¶ Futures only put in a 23.5 points of total movement on futures which is 43% of the 10 day average‚Ä¶ to say today was a tight range is an understatement. 

We also closed today at 47mil volume (that will probably rise to about 55-60mil by 8pm but this would make it one of the lowest volume days of the year‚Ä¶. The current lowest of 2023 is April 19th which was a 55mil volume day. 

The market despite what it tried to lead on last week clearly is a little on edge for CPI on Wednesday.

We currently find ourselves trading just over the middle of this 405 to 415 channel. We are slowly creeping our way up to that 415.56 and 417.03 supply (resistance). Right now after we established demand at 405.06 last week the trend still is the upside and until a new supply (Resistance) is put in I would be looking for further upside. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a6wxc9ns3oya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6621ba0880a3b8f06df3d78d3cc164b34414c9b3

We closed out yet another doji candle. This time though one could even argue this is a hanging man candle. Which would signal a short term top. However, we with only an 11 cent higher close than Friday its tough to say where this trend wants to go. 

The bulls did come down and test the daily 8ema and reconfirm it as support. I had plans to EOD Tuesday open some longer DTE puts on SPY‚Ä¶ I was looking and hoping to be able to enter closer to 415-417‚Ä¶ I was tempted to enter those today but knowing the unpredictability of SPY I decided to wait till tomorrow. 

With the VIX at 17 two days till CPI and SPY coming in on key 415.6 to 417 supplies/ resistance I like my risk to reward for puts‚Ä¶ think about it not even looking at the numbers on CPI‚Ä¶ is the risk to the downside or the upside? Currently the risk is to the downside. 

Fun fact we still have 4 daily gaps on Spy‚Ä¶ 396.49-398.68, 401.6-401.76, 407.77-407.27 and 407.27- 408.64.

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 415.6 -> 417  
 Demand- 405 -> 404.3  
 Support- 408.9 -> 407.9 -> 407 -> 405.2  
 Resistance- 414.9 -> 415.6 -> 416.8

Currently futures also finds itself in this 4074 to 4190 chop zone‚Ä¶ this 4150 has been a real magnet in the markets‚Ä¶

With the demand being made on Friday we favor a push back to 4190 or a new supply (resistance) being established. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1lr05iit3oya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6185727fe6da88fca9a7ae5e6b792abcd68fec78

Now when we look at the daily candle here on futures the bulls were able to avoid the true 4150 double top/ doji which woulda made me feel 100% confident in over night puts‚Ä¶ but this makes it a little more indecisive. Futures daily still has about 45 minutes till close so I will watch for that close. 

Realistically with the daily 8ema being taken back and the 8ema holding as support here one would have to favor the bullish case on futures as well‚Ä¶

Honestly until after CPI on Wednesday we are likely to see some chop in this 4150 to 4190 range. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4190 -> 4198  
 Demand- 4074  
 Support- 4150 ->4110 -> 4095  
 Resistance- 4180 -> 4191 -> 4199

Now the VIX1D here is holding a nice downward trend. Now we are still in the early stages of learning VIX1D but im am watching closely still‚Ä¶ one thing that I do note here is that we are now coming into that 8.49 support area which is where we double bottomed before. 

There is still a VIX1D gap at 14.55 to 14.71 too. 

&#x200B;

Now on the VIX here it actually for a little bit of time had me convinced of it not closing red‚Ä¶ actually for most of the day the VIX held about a 50 cent range.

There has been a lot of disconnect in the VIX and markets but lately I have got to say its correlated pretty well‚Ä¶ Favoritism would be to the downside on the VIX which is the upside on spy.

Today was a really rough trading day. That extremely tight range we had today was just trap after trap. In my trading I use technicals a lot for entries and exits and today was not a technical based day. I was able to grab a few wins here and there but still put in a red day. But overall not that bad of a day. Easily recoverable by EOW if not tomorrow.",2023-05-08 20:31:10,58,"Hi, thanks for all you do.

Curious- why do you think volatility indices should have to worry about gap filling? Isn't it just a simple calculation of movement in the 30 day (and now 0DTE) options chain? Why would it move in a chartable fashion? 

I too am watching VIX1D to figure out it's place.

And next step in my education is learning supply and demand zones - do you have any trusted learning materials to point me towards? 

Overall, I've been paper trading for WEEKS with insane green days. Then last Friday I decided to get in for real and the complete lack of volume then ans today killed me. Big red and popped my bubble on how confident I am with my strategy. I get outlier days happen, but I was hoping I'd have a bunch of wins racked up before having red days. Oh well. If I'd just picked calls Friday I'd have been set - but if you make trades outside your strategy that is when you are gambling. 

So I noticed you trade SPX. What's your strategy there? 1DTE I saw, what delta do you usually go for? Any issues with volume on fills? Do you do market fills or set a limit?

I typically trade a 5 or 10 SPY contracts at a Delta of .5 to .6 and go out however many days until theta is flat across the strikes. Typically 3 but sometimes as low as 1 or as high as 4.

I know SPX is tax advantaged but my understanding is that SPY has tighter spreads and market fills are very reliable. Obviously trade off is commission fees."

We believe the reasons for low volatility are technical in nature with the market dominated by option sellers. Selling of options forces intraday reversion, leaving the market price virtually unchanged many days.

926,Debt Ceiling Scenarios from the White House,Discussion,"Despite some movement in the debt ceiling talks, significant progress remains elusive. Reportedly, President Biden has offered the Republicans potential compromises, which include the possible use of unspent coronavirus relief funds in order to cut back on government spending.

Following a meeting in the Oval Office yesterday, President Biden and Kevin McCarthy agreed to have their aides participate in daily discussions to identify potential areas of agreement. This decision comes in response to the looming threat of a default, which could occur as early as June 1.

As previously outlined, with the deadline for raising the U.S. debt ceiling drawing ever nearer, financial markets are likely to grow increasingly nervous. An actual breach, of course, could cause substantial damage to both the U.S. economy and the rest of the world.

[Should the U.S. government default](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2023/05/03/debt-ceiling-scenarios/) on its obligations to creditors, contractors, and citizens, millions of people might face job loss. With the government unable to enact counter-cyclical measures, there would be limited options to alleviate the impact on households and businesses.

**Anything Else?**

The cost of borrowing for the government, and consequently for taxpayers, would significantly increase. The ability of firms to finance themselves and to make productive investments would also be adversely affected. Furthermore, there would likely be a surge in volatility in equity and corporate bond markets.

**Fitch Ratings** has stated that, in the event of an actual default, ‚Äúthe US's rating would be downgraded to 'RD' (Restricted Default), and affected Treasury securities would be assigned a 'D'."" As a kind of early warning, last Friday, Scope Ratings placed the US AA long-term issuer rating under review for a potential downgrade. Additionally:

‚Ä¢ **Moody's** cautions that even a brief debt limit breach could result in a decline in real GDP, nearly 2 million job losses, and an increase in the unemployment rate to almost 5%.

‚Ä¢ A **Brookings** analysis suggests that losing the safety and liquidity of the Treasury market due to default could lead to over $750 billion in higher federal borrowing costs over the next decade.

‚Ä¢ And **Peterson Institute** economists argue that lower demand for Treasuries could weaken the dollar's role in the global economy.

A protracted default\* would result in a severe recession, akin to the Great Recession. During the first full quarter of the simulated debt ceiling breach in Q3 of 2023, the stock market would plummet by 45%, severely impacting retirement accounts.

Moreover, consumer and business confidence would be significantly affected, leading to a reduction in consumption and investment. Consequently, unemployment would rise by 5 percentage points as consumers reduce their spending, and businesses lay off workers.

\* *Protracted default* refers to the inability of a buyer to pay the contractual debt within a specified period, calculated from the due date or any extended due date of the debt.",2023-05-10 10:14:41,57,Are these stories not planted in the media to drum up some volatility so folks can make some money?

946,Unveiling My $132k PLTR Trade: Leveraging Anomaly-Detection Strategy and Greek Moons,Discussion,"The trade was focused on PLTR and employed an anomaly detection strategy. In addition to my usual analysis, I integrated a novel tool - the Greek Moons.

**Background**

On 5/5/2023, I invested in 8.00 call options for PLTR set to expire on 5/12/2023, at $0.20 per option. A week later, on 5/12/2023, I sold these options for $1.52 each, bringing in a total profit of $132,000.

**The Data**

The successful execution of this trade depended on an anomaly detection strategy that harnessed the following data:

* Daily PLTR Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume
* 20, 50, and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA)
* Stochastic Oscillator (%K and %D)
* Greek Moons data
* VIX Gamma High, Low, and Spread

**Key Insights & Anomaly Detection**

The linchpin of my strategy was identifying market anomalies, unusual patterns often signaling substantial price fluctuations. In this instance, the anomalies were pinpointed using Greek Moons, an advanced tool that aids traders in detecting unusual options market activities.

The Greek Moons tool averages Greek values based on expiration and moneyness and shows the rate of change daily. This information was pivotal in predicting an unusual move in PLTR. On 5/5/2023, the Greek Moons data, coupled with PLTR being below its 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day SMAs, indicated a potential oversold condition. The Stochastic %K was also in oversold territory, adding further support to the potential for an upward price movement.

By 5/12/2023, PLTR's price had risen substantially, allowing me to sell my call options for a significant profit. The Stochastic %K had also moved into overbought territory, suggesting that PLTR's price might start to retreat, thus strengthening my decision to sell.

**Deep Dive Data**

The subsequent data shows a detailed view of the market variables and indicators that led to my decision to trade on the specific dates:

**Conclusion**

This example demonstrates how unconventional data sources, such as Greek Moons, can complement traditional indicators in making trading decisions. It's important to remember, though, that past performance is not a definitive predictor of future results. The nature of the stock market is unpredictability, hence the importance of diligent research and a careful assessment of risk tolerance.

950,The Wild $AMZN Ride - How I Bagged $12K in Profits While Y'all Apes Struggled,Gain,"Sup fellow degenerates, gather 'round and let me tell you the tale of how I banked a sweet $12k on $AMZN shares while the rest of you paper-handed fools prob lost stacks or broke even at best. So, buckle up and let's dive into this rollercoaster of a story.

It was earnings week for the tech giants - you know, the likes of $META, $GOOG, and $MSFT. And then, the star of this post: $AMZN. I started building my position back when $FDX beat earnings in March, grabbing 500 shares at a neat $100/share, and then adding another 1000 shares on April 21st just under $107.

Why, you ask? Simple. More packages = Ecommerce boom = analysts being dumbasses. Then, $UPS missed earnings and I decided to drop 500 of my $AMZN shares 'cause your boy ain't about to lose the house over Bezos‚Äô baby.

So, this week was wild. The market had a seizure during trading hours, but then $MSFT & $GOOG reported and it's like we hopped on a rocket straight to the moon. Tech stocks went absolutely bonkers and I caught $MSFT, but that‚Äôs for another post.

And then, our Lord and Savior, $META, crushed earnings on Wednesday. Sentiment flip-flopped like a fish out of water. Clearly, these mega-cap stocks were beating expectations and were hella undervalued.

What happened next? Well, the Nasdaq $QQQ went up nearly 3%, and Amazon shot up 4.5% to almost $110. Now, usually, I'd slap on a +5 to +10% call option, but not this time. No siree, I was going in raw hoping I won‚Äôt have 18-years bad luck the next morning.

So, $AMZN reported and it just exploded - from $110 to $122 in under 2 minutes. They beat EPS by 50% and revenue by $3 billion. Absolute madness. But, like a true WallStreetBets veteran (check my all-time hottest post), I knew what to do.

An hour later, the earnings call was scheduled. Y'know, where they get into the nitty-gritty and talk about future guidance (aka the mood killer). I figured a 22% gain in a month was more than enough tendies, so I started selling off my shares after-hours. It dipped a bit from the $122 high, but I still came out on top.

And now, the aftermath: $AMZN is sitting at $105.00 - Current position: 4 shares. Feels good, man. Proof of positions and my fat gains belowüëá

Instead of the first years fetching the coffees, copies, lunches and orders from Dorsia we will now have to assign 2nd and 3rd years for the task.

This will hurt productivity since they have been untrained for a few years and will take some adjusting.

Since covid hit, most restaurants don't give a fuck so you really gotta be on your toes on order checks.

If not, you come back with half the order and by the time you get it right and bring it back to the office its dinner time. 

This could take months before everything is running smooth again, but everyone is preparing.

Bain recently told M.B.A.s with offer letters that if they waited to start until April 2024, the firm would pay them $40,000 to work for a nonprofit or $30,000 to learn a new language or participate in an educational program, in one communication that suggested hires could also become yoga instructors or go on safari for $20,000.

Some of you will try all three for $90k and then figure out what to do to make up the rest for a year. 

You probably already went over your skis spending lavishly with your new big boy job offer that just got delayed, but hey at least you get to learn some new skills.

Those who survive will get that $175k paycheck eventually, but naturally this is thinning the herd. 

Only the rich bastards will go on the safari for $20k and continue the YOLO's like true WSB players.

959,AI - genuinely terrifying,Discussion,"I realize this has been considered a lot by many.

I'm just freaking out because I've used AI enough now that I have a much better understanding of the capabilities.

I asked AI about the potential impact on US jobs and it responded that 43% of jobs can be replaced by AI now.

That doesn't take into consideration AI directed robots.

I spent a decade as an operations analyst.

I've been playing with ChatGPT and DALL-E 2.and with those tools the good paying job that allowed me to retire is completely redundant.

We cannot integrate AI into our working economy with our current economic system.

If profit remains ""all"" then the only logical course for any company is to replace as many employees as possible with AI and robots. This includes everyone from Executives/CEOs to line workers.

That will result in a global recession far beyond anything imagined during the worst of the 1930s.

If you have a job that is primarily thinking - AI can do it better and ridiculously faster.

Bottom line is that everyone needs to look for a job that can't be done by a robot receiving instructions in real-time by an AI and you've got a year if you get paid for thinking and maybe five years if you do something a directed robot could do.

E.g: Robot repair/maintenance.

965,CMA bank might be going under soon.... here's the how/why,DD,"Let's DD...

I'm going to be referencing their Q1 earnings report along with some reports they presented after that and why I think there was major red warning flags flashing at the bank which were and still are being overlooked.

Here's where you can find their Q1 report: [https://investor.comerica.com/presentations-events](https://investor.comerica.com/presentations-events)

First off, the bank is prototypical to the current banks which have failed this far.... Large long term HTM assets which are now losing billions in value per quarter, along with a splurge of covid lending which has begun to lose their past positive gains, if not all of them,  as of the end of Q1, and they are at risk in their loan to deposit ratio due to currently holding massive unsecured deposits which are at flight risk and ballooning the banks Loan to debt liabilities.

The HTM assets they are booking have been in the multi billions per quarter range while they are in debt \~15b and only have 9b cash.  **This means all of the cash they claim to have on hand is on paper only due to not having to liquidate HTM assets, YET...**

**In their Q1 earnings report, they had already nearly maxed out their FHLB loan programs, indicated they were already preparing to go to the discount window for 20b and in addition to that... (when no one knew/gave a shit about the BTFP) this bank had already pre-calculated they could go in and get 9b in loans to max on over on the BTFP. (a major red flag!!!!! especially since we can see there's still \~5bn in BTFP loans outstanding as of today...)**

I believe the reason they had included all these ""features"" of how to access liquidity at this point was because they they had realized they were majorly at risk to far exceeded their deposit to loan ratios  when accounting for  the fact that they had 11 billion in deposit flight just a few months prior, HTM asset unrealized losses, now in the multi billions, and further deposit flight risk with their over 50% uninsured deposit foundation of which they were lending out on.    With fancy math, and not accounting for their Unrealized losses on their lending practices they claimed to have an 85% Loan to deposit ratio.  The problem here is they openly admit they have approximately 64 billion in deposits, of which 53% are basically a flight risk due to being non-interest bearing & uninsured deposits.  The previous quarter saw a 11 billion flight of deposits and they still maintained well over 30 billion of deposits that were at high flight risk.  

Let's make this clear... The bank knowingly has over 30 billion at risk of deposit flight and when tallied along with their HTM unrealized losses and 15b in debts essentially means the bank is at risk of becoming insolvent due to just a few depositors wising up and moving their money to interest bearing accounts...  I think the bank understood this at the start of Q1 once they witnessed an 11billion outflow of deposits but decided to parade around they can get liquidity but that's not the real problem here....

The bank has increased their lending activities over the last few years to hit 50billion in loans during the covid boom when liquidity was easy and lending was cheap and even won awards for having created the most loans over all other competitors last year... which I think is going to come back to bite their ass soon and here's why:

The bank has been one of the biggest lenders in Michigan to the corporate/business sectors ever since 2020-2021 but the bank stated in their Q1 report they expected 9% annualized growth in these sectors... yet just a short while later they announced their internal metrics/reporting which showed a decline in business activity by over -4% for the previous quarter...  

How did they ever calculate that they will hit 9% growth when they just suffered -4% declines in the previous quarter into a rate hiking environment?  The bank obviously had internal tracking metrics here and saw their commercial businesses slowing down but still said they expect a bounce back of 13% over 9 mo into further rate hikes after lending like madmen during peak bubble?    The company in this Q1 report also said they were increasing their allocations for defaults going up to nearly 1 billion, or 2% of their total lending practices.....    **To make it simple...  they're basically just a regarded as all of us here on WSB by expecting 13% growth while at the same time knowingly planning for massive losses and deposit flight risk as we headed deeper into the year with  higher rates...**

Let's make this clear... The bank knowingly has over 30 billion at risk of deposit flight (after already losing 11billion) they still remain at risk from just a handful of customers who can easily get 3-5% on their money.  When tallied along with their HTM unrealized losses, 15b in debts, and 50b in commercial loans which are slowing down and facing increased default rates, pre-planning to access the BTFP (the most desperate grab for cash from the fed of which we know \~5b is outstanding in the BTFP program....) 

So yeah, I think this bank knows they are actually getting obliterated in terms of growth prospects... but did the song and dance to try and say they weren't a bank on the brink of collapse...

So to summarize, I believe the bank is at serious risk of becoming insolvent and collapsing due to just a few depositors wising up and moving their money to interest bearing accounts (which may have already happened?) 

**CMA bank looks like it's been staging and preparing as a FDIC candidate since Q1 and will likely end up being sold off for profitable acquisition rewards for years away...**

Yes they have an okay business model, but it's a business model which became extremely at risk due to higher rates, massive unsecured deposit flight risks, excessive peak bubble lending which is now having increased default rates, and HTM assets which hold multibillions in unrealized losses on their balance sheet.

The real question here is not if the bank might fail, but more so, how soon?

TBH I thought about this for a good while before deciding to buy puts here, the reality is just plain and simple.... this bank, unfortunately, fits like a cookie cutter perfectly into having the same systemic problems as what's actually been causing banks to go under thus far, and I doubt they are some magical bank that can escape this coming fate.  They claim they might be able to mitigated their HTM damage, but only after we passed 4.5%, the fact still remains that they have a very large deposit flight and had lending practices which are now turning into potential \~billion in losses...

The final cherry on top?  Cramer was lamenting that this bank might go under and was being treated ""unfairly"" just yesterday which is what actually made me go investigate their risk/q1 report.  I understand it's easy to blame short sellers, but in reality, this is on the bank for sitting on their hands and ignoring interest rate risk while the fed hiked up to 5% thinking they can just ignore what was happening to their balance sheet.

**TL:DR? CMA bank** is massively at risk for solvency issues and was a peak covid bubble lender which is now turning sour.  The bank knowingly has a multibillion uninsured deposit flight risk problem while holding onto additional billions in unrealized losses via HTM treasuries/lending risks which means they are teetering on the verge of becoming insolvent due to 30b of deposits which can easily be moved away, and is incentivized, to better than a 0% rate.",2023-05-05 18:30:41,49,"[screenshot email](https://i.imgur.com/5euh5Nu.jpg)

Now that we have seen one day of this‚Ä¶ I will be very curious to see how the VIX1D does EOD with correlation to the next day. 

My next major target and potential source of a bounce on SPY is 405.2/ 4055 Futures. 

**MSFT**

Really nice beat there on MSFT EPS and revenue wise pretty much a sweep across the board.

I did not play MSFT earnings as I just honestly generally do not play earnings‚Ä¶ though I am considering a META and AMZN lotto play‚Ä¶ but overall looks like MSFT is going to have a nice upside move. 292 will be a major upside weekly target and resistance for MSFT.

Goog actually came in with a beat on EPS too and some pretty decent revenue beats‚Ä¶ they also authorized an impressive 70 billion buyback too. 

I actually would have expected a miss on google and this is its first beat on EPS since Q1 2022.

Taking a look at daily supply and demand here I mentioned how with the way supply and demand has been moving lately I would not be surprised to see us immediately turn around today and turn demandt back into supply‚Ä¶ that is exactly what we did‚Ä¶ 412 demand now becomes 412.62 supply. 

We also came all the way down and took our 409.73 supply finally. We did fall just short of 405.17 supply though. 

If we continue this sell off tomorrow our target is 405.17 followed by a bigger eow and into next week sell off to 399.07 supply. If we can take out 399.07 supply then I would be more confident in a longer term and stronger bounce to the upside.

SPY officailly has broken out of the 15 day long range of 406.6 to 415.6 with todays close. Not only that we closed our first -1%+ day since March 22nd. 

We also clsoed under the daily 20ema for the first time since March 23rd. One thing on SPY is it likes to back test the EMAs. Now I did think we could immediately turn around and reject that daily 8ema recovery from yesterday the bloody premarket made tahtjust a straight drop. We came dangerously close to hitting 405.2 today but we were not quite able to get there‚Ä¶ I will be watching that level extremely close going forward. 

If we can break through and CLOSE under 405.2 I feel fairly confident in a sell off down to that 399-400 area. However, IF the bulls can hard bounce us off 405.2 and potentailly turn 405.13 supply into demand then I actually would favor a push back up to 412-416 leading into FOMC.

I wouldn‚Äôt be totally surprised to see an upside push tomorrow to retest the daily 20ema resistance. As long as we close under that I would remain bearish going forward. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 405.1 -> 399  
 Demand- 406.7 -> 409.2  
 Support- 405.2 -> 404.2  
 Resistance- 408.1 -> 409.1 -> 410.6

Just like SPY futures immediately turned around and turned 4153 demand into supply (resistance) at 4157.

We did not take out any previous demands or supplies today but we did close below that key 4116 demand. We now have a fairly large gap in supply/ demand with downside target at 4040/4055. We also have a supply all the way down at 4015 that too needs to be taken out.

When I said that futures could immediately turn around and make 4160 a double top looking at the TOS chart that is exactly what I was talking about. Actually this is where my love hate relationship with TV forms as I love TV for ease of charting but its price action is ‚Äúoof‚Äù sometimes‚Ä¶ as you can see on TOS futures closed a confirmed 4157 double top but if you look below its not an actual double top on trading view.

Now the biggest thing here to note is that we too did break out and close below the 4113 to 4178 channel that we have been consolidating in for 15 days‚Ä¶ With a break down like this on futures and spy we should 100% expect a bigger move to be had. Now prior to MSFT and GOOG earnings being released we actually were setting up for a closure under 4095 which is a majorly bearish movement. 

I will look for a possible retest of the daily 20ema at 4125 tomorrow and then look for a continuation back and closure back under 4095. If bears can get this closed under 4095 I do for see that bigger push down to the daily 100/200ema at 4040/4055. However, IF bulls can bounce us off good earnings then there is a chance that we will see a push back to 4138 resistance before attempting to retest 4160-4198 area. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4160 -> 4055  
 Demand- 4116 -> 4005  
 Support- 4095 -> 4080  
 Resistance- 4118 -> 4138 -> 4160

The VIX had an impressive day today being up about 18% at one point. Now we always have to look at the WHY‚Ä¶ why was the VIX pumping today and SPY dumping? Well FRC said it might sell up to 100 billion in assets‚Ä¶ why does this matter? Well this shows that this banking crisis is far from over‚Ä¶ Markets needed a reason to sell and we might have gotten that reason finally‚Ä¶

Now we did see a pretty sizeable drop on the VIX by EOD but if we continue to see more banking issues we very well might see continuation to the downside despite what the big tech earnings do this week.

Whats actually interesting to me today is that probability of a 25bps rate hike next week dropped from about 88% to 77% today‚Ä¶ people are now beginning again to think that JPOW is going to pause because of the banking crisis. üì∑

Even more wild is that we are beginning to price in a CUT in June already (this of course assumes we get a 25 bps hike next week).

I had a field trip with my daughter today so I wasn‚Äôt able to trade but I was able to close my long term 405 puts pretty much at the LOD. I wouldn‚Äôt have minded holding these but being OTM and I was heavy in these I wanted to close and reposition.

Tomorrow we will get a CORE PPI, PPI and unemployment claims release‚Ä¶ the interesting thing about the PPI prints is that this will be a possible bigger rebound on PPI/ CORE‚Ä¶ last prints actually were one of the best ive seen with a negative print‚Ä¶ so a rebound into the positives could be poorly received. 

I once again find myself thinking ‚Äúwhat is going to cause this market to sell off?‚Äù but not only sell off‚Ä¶ but continuously sell off‚Ä¶ and with CPI coming in soft I truly outside of another bank collapsing do not see a reason to expect a sustainable sell off‚Ä¶ however, I also based on this 5 week long and really 7 week long range on the weekly with extremely low volume also don‚Äôt see the support for further upside‚Ä¶ We officially have found ourselves in the pain zone‚Ä¶

The one common theme that I continue to see here on these SPY sell off days that then lead to massive intraday V bottoms is that TECH never truly sells off with the market‚Ä¶ in my opinion until we see tech show true weakness and truly lead the sell off‚Ä¶ these dips will continue to be bought up.

Well I had mentioned I was surprised yesterday that we didn‚Äôt turn that doji candle into a supply‚Ä¶ however, we ended up turning in a new supply today‚Ä¶ however, this becomes problematic‚Ä¶ why? Well simple‚Ä¶ closing a daily candle over a supply that we just established is fairly imbalanced. So most probable that we need to do is eventually come back down to take out this 411.15 or at minimum close under it to attempt to establish a new demand (support) before we push back up. 

This imbalance here shows just how rangy and choppy this market has been. We still have strong support at 404.3 to 405 and strong resistance at 415.56 to 417‚Ä¶ generally when a new supply is put in we favor a move to demand which would be 405.06‚Ä¶ however, this imbalance actually would favor a move to 415.56 supply first.

When I take a look at the daily here I honestly want to see a bigger bull flag forming here‚Ä¶ but I also obviously see a notable rising wedge that we have been in since February/ march. 

Todays hanging man candle is a tricky one as it actually is a bullish engulfing candle too. One could infer today was a retest of daily 8/20ema support and with the bounce and closure back over it that we would push higher‚Ä¶ but as hopeful as I was that today would FINALLY give some answers to a direction for EOW and EOM‚Ä¶ I am once again left with more questions than answers‚Ä¶ I personally don‚Äôt see a reason as I mentioned at the beginning to go long until we break the weekly range we have been in for almost 2 months. Until that happens we remain in some painful ranges‚Ä¶ 

I actually wouldn‚Äôt be that surprised to see a pretty sizable drop in volume again tomorrow and more tight range trading of the $2-3 range.

Here is where I love following ES along with SPY as they especially with supply and demand show a different story‚Ä¶ 

Now yesterday we made that 4152 supply‚Ä¶ today we immediately turned around and established a new 4135 demand (support) and closed over 4152 supply (resistance)‚Ä¶ to me this opens up an opportunity to go long back to 4190-4198 supplies. 

I based on futures‚Ä¶ which I find to be far more clear and helpful in this choppy tight reversal happy daily ranges‚Ä¶ would be bullish and look for upside until a new supply is once again established.

Now taking a look at futures daily price action today actually turned into a 2 day bullish engulfing candle‚Ä¶ granted this is a very long bodied DOJI‚Ä¶ I actually see the huge daily 2 month long daily bull flag on futures but I also see a 5 day long bull flag on futures too‚Ä¶ this would open the possibility to run back to that 4191-4199 area tomorrow or at least EOW.

Well taking a look a here at the vix1d daily chart you can see that we attempted to breakout over the daily 8ema again and rejected. It also is notable that we are in a red bear channel and have nice slow blue support line‚Ä¶ 

One could infer that until this down channel on vix1d is broken that we are stuck in more of this chop/ neutrally bullish price action. 

Now on the VIX you can see we did break trough the support of the red bull channel and have no formed a new white/ blue falling wedge inside of the major blue falling wedge. 

The current trend on the VIX is clearly down and realistically until that changes there is very little reason to expect sustained and long term downside on Spy‚Ä¶ one thing that is notable though is that the VIX and SPY are correlating fairly well again. If and when the VIX closes under 16.96 support we have a nice little sell off shaping up down to that 15.72 support area which very well could propel SPY up to the 418-420 range.

One key thing I am seeing here is that especially DXY is currently showing is a massive downward resistance line that it has been trading within since the March 8th peak‚Ä¶ one thing that I also believe will show the next leg down and sustain that leg down is a true DXY breakout which means the dollar regaining strength‚Ä¶ it has absolutely gotten beaten up the last 2 months now. If and when that strength returns it should take TECH down with its strength‚Ä¶ you can see much of the same trend here on 10YR which shows we are still in a massive downward move on 10yr‚Ä¶ 

If and when these two in tandem breakout and the VIX breaks out‚Ä¶ we might finally see a leg down‚Ä¶ until then I still favor this neutral to bullish range trading.

979,Consumer strength is the primary driving force for this market right now,Discussion,"It‚Äôs seeming more and more clear that the market did not realize how resilient the consumer is in this economy. 

The markets coming into the year expected a recession to come Q1/Q2 of 2023. They expected rate hikes to cause a weakening job sector and weaker consumer. However, to this day jobs reports have been incredibly strong and the only sector seeing a weakening job market is the tech sector. 

We‚Äôre seeing consumer companies reporting big earnings beating estimates that were previously sandbagged. It‚Äôs clear when you see gambling companies like Draftkings and travel companies like hotels reporting big numbers that the average consumer is simply not hurting. 

Based off of this, my prediction is that inflation will remain sticky. If the Fed is looking at jobs data and lagging indicators like CPI and PCE to determine when to pause, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre done seeing rate hikes and we won‚Äôt see a rate cut this year.

Caveat: If the banking crisis further worsens that could cause a credit crunch that will undoubtedly send us into a recession and force the fed to loosen policy.",2023-05-05 20:08:18,43,People are making 4 payments for a pizza

983,Why I'm getting MSFT calls for earnings.,DD,"Microsoft (MSFT) will report its third fiscal quarter (Q3) 2023 results today after the market closes. The report will cover the quarter from January 2023 to March 2023.

**Microsoft Earnings Expectation**

Revenues: $51.05 billion. 4% year-over-year growth but 4% lower than the previous quarter.

EPS: $2.23, no change from a year ago and 3.8% lower than Q2.

**What to watch for**

Out of the three business divisions, the Intelligent Cloud department has become Microsoft‚Äôs gold mine nowadays, contributing 40% of the group‚Äôs total revenue with sound and solid growth momentum. In the previous quarter, the cloud services‚Äô revenue increased 18% while whole group‚Äôs revenue only added 2%.

For the to-be-reported quarterly earnings, Microsoft anticipated revenues from the Intelligent Cloud will keep increasing at the pace between 17% and 19% to a range of $21.7-$22 billion. However, Microsoft also flagged that Azure, the cloud computing platform that which is one of the main engines of the cloud business, would slow down its growing speed by 4 or 5 percentage points to near 30% in the fiscal third quarter, down from 46% in the same period last year.

Q2 FY23 Financial Summary: https://i.imgur.com/zNmvSEH.png

**The laggard**

The downtrend in the global personal computing industry has accelerated in the past year. So did Microsoft‚Äôs PC business. In the six months ended December 31th, the revenue from the PC related business was down 11% YOY, while in the last three month, the yearly downfall rate was speed up to 19%.

The first quarter of this year has marked the fifth consecutive quarter of global PC sales decline. As such, it's not difficult to see that this hard-to-stop slide will further falter the demand for all the product line under the umbrella of Personal Computing. The used-to-be-proud King of the PC projected this sector's revenue for Q3 will be between $11.9 billion and $12.3 billion, indicating a 14%-17% decline from the same quarter last year.

**The AI Race**

The battlefield for the AI race has been set up and the smoke is getting intense.

Microsoft seemly led the way for now thanks to its shared commitment with OpenAI to build generative AI systems--ChatGPT has convinced the world in 2023 that, AI will become a topping layer of technology and prompt a new generation of ‚Äúplatform shift‚Äù.

Clearly, all the tech giants are not hesitated to go all-in in the AI race and are ready to thrive in this new age. Microsoft, despite racing inches ahead now, is facing the fiercest competition in decades. Alphabet, Google‚Äôs parent company, unveiled a similar AI function in March for Gmail, which is now used by 1.8 billion people around the world. Apple disclosed that 45% of its M&A targets are AI-related compared to Microsoft‚Äôs 23% now. In terms of the bright minds, Meta has employed 23.5% of staff with AI skills while Microsoft‚Äôs ratio is 21.8%

Additionally, the ticket to the AI race is very costly. Microsoft has boosted its R&D investment in the previous quarter by 18% to 6.8 billion, which, saw its net margin fell from 36% to 30% in the September quarter.

As Chairman and CEO of Microsoft Satya Nadella said in January: ‚ÄúThe next major wave of computing is being born.‚Äù Microsoft is not shy with its ambition to be the king of the new wave, the challenge being, all its old foes are thinking the same.

**Microsoft Share Price**

Despite the bright limelight this year thanks to ChatGPT, Microsoft‚Äôs stock price didn‚Äôt enjoy extra shine compared to other tech titans. But the good news is the price has clearly bottomed out from the Nov-Jan low when the two-year-low was made.

Based on the weekly chat, the stock is currently attempting to challenge the August peak at around 291-296, a hurdle that could open the door to $300 psychological level if successfully conquered.

Conversely, if the break fails, any pullback should be supported by the 100-MA to preserve the bull-biased momentum. However, a fall below this level will risk further breaching the current ascending trajectory and increase the chance of a bear-reversal.

But the recent price movements are not going to play a role in whether it goes up or down tonight. I believe it would be smart to get calls for earnings. I think a MSFT call spread would be good. Buy the 4/28 280c and sell the 290c, which would cost about $277.

As we gear up for another week, let's take a look at the economic calendar, specifically focusing on Monday's lineup. At 8:30 am Eastern Time, we begin with the release of the Empire State manufacturing survey for the month of May. A slight chill might run through the market, as the median forecast is currently pegged at a less-than-optimistic -5.0. This is a dramatic swing from the previous 10.8, indicating a possible shift in the manufacturing sector.

However, the day's events are far from over. Concurrently, the Chicago Fed President Goolsbee will make a televised appearance, promising a rich discussion and invaluable insights into the current economic landscape.

Finally, the morning's agenda concludes at 9:15 am with a presentation from the Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari. His remarks are always keenly anticipated and will certainly provide much fodder for market analysis. So, as we embrace the new week, stay tuned for a Monday filled with informative and potentially market-moving events.

**Daily Chart**

Bears failed to close under 408.87 and the gap at 408.64 - 402.72 remains protected. We have liquidity at 414.89 and a gap at 414.77 - 415.27 that bulls will try to overcome this week. A close above 415.27 opens the door for a liquidity grab at 417.62 and 418.31. Bears need to take out prior day low at 408.87 for the 408.64 - 402.72 gap fill.

Bears swept the previous day's low at 409.97 and grabbed liquidity at the order block from May 10th. Buyers came in with increased volume. We saw a character change at 410.70 and swept liquidity at 411.58. We have resting liquidity above at 412.01. On the late bounce, bulls created a fair value gap at 410.47 - 410.80 and 410.39 - 410.27, currently holding as support AH. On the way down, bears left a few fair value gaps at 412.40 - 412.52 and 412.93 - 413.16 that bulls will look to fill on Monday. The current price action favors the bulls here.

**1H Chart**

Bulls came in 170.69  - 171.14 order block. We have a change of character at 170.67. Close under the character change on the hourly, and price action will favor the bears to test buy-side discounts.

987,Morning Briefing üåû May 4th 2023,Discussion,"Good Morning everyone! The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by 0.25% on Wednesday, the tenth time it has done so since last year. However, the Fed also signaled that it may be done with rate hikes for the time being. This news was not enough to calm investors, who sent stocks tumbling on the day. The fear of a recession is still looming large, and the banking sector is particularly vulnerable. Shares of PacWest Bank, a California-based regional bank, tumbled in premarket trading on Thursday after the bank said it was weighing all strategic options, including a possible sale. Another sign of the economic slowdown is the IPO market, which has largely come to a halt. The only major IPO this year has been that of Kenvue, the consumer health business being spun out of Johnson & Johnson. The IPO was priced at $22 a share, which is below the expected range. Even Google, one of the world's most successful companies, is feeling the effects of the slowdown. CEO Sundar Pichai made $226 million in 2022, but the company is now cutting costs and laying off employees. This has angered some Google employees, who have been critical of Pichai and other executives in internal communications. Overall, the news from the financial markets on Wednesday was not good. The Fed's rate hike was not enough to calm investors, and the fear of a recession is still very real.

**DAL** - Delta juts crossed below all daily moving averages which could lead to a larger move lower over the coming weeks.

**UBER** - Uber is topping out around $38 which is where shares topped out in early February. I believe we could see a rejection of this level especially when considering the stock is overbought according to RSI.",2023-05-04 13:18:41,46,r/remindmebot 10 hours

Huge differences in consumer spending and inventories. Inventories really fell off a cliff, meaning companies produced or acquired less inventories - most likely trying to reduce supply and stockpiling.

Likewise, jobless claims went down a lot, lower than expected +248K (actual +230K). Last week was +246K.

The only other news was Core PCE QoQ was +4.9% higher than +4.7% expected (last Q was +4.4%). Interestingly Cleveland Fed was also expecting +4.7%. So inflation not exactly good in the first quarter. Likewise +1.1% got dragged down by a miscalucation of inflation, meaning if inflation was +4.7%, GDP would be >1.3% ish.

Generally, the economy is damn resilient for now. Spending is still holding up, but businesses are just reducing their stockpiles and not buying more. In general, companies who sell products to consumers directly might be OK, but companies who only provide stock to companies on a secondary basis (ie not B2C but B2B) might hurt.

# On tomorrow (big big day)

1. **ECI Employment Cost Index QoQ est +1.1%.**
2. **Core PCE est +4.5%.**
3. BoJ Japan first ever meeting by the new governor est no change.
4. Japan Tokyo Core Inflation April est +3.2%
5. EU GDP Q1 est +0.2%.
6. Germany prelim inflation for April est +7.3%.
7. France prelim inflation for April est +5.7%.

Core PCE most likely will surprise to the upside due to QoQ GDP surprise. I'll be updating this post when the Cleveland Fed updates later today.

ECI is the big big issue. [https://22vresearch.com/2023/04/13/follow-up-on-a-couple-points-related-to-inflation-measurement/](https://22vresearch.com/2023/04/13/follow-up-on-a-couple-points-related-to-inflation-measurement/) ECI is the Fed's preferred measure of wage inflation.

With the Atlanta Fed super accurate on GDP +1.1% vs +1.1%, I'm trusting their wage tracker: [https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker](https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker)

According to 22V, ECI will most likely surprise to the upside. Last quarter was +1%. Maybe +1.1%, or even higher, unlikely staying flat. Even if it was +1.1% as expected, the ECI staying flat is bad news for the Fed, since it generally indicates a ""starting"" of the wage price spiral.
