1,How and why OIL is being used to slap the VIX,Discussion,"Had a lot of questions about how OIL is being used to compress the VIX.  I will attempt to explain in terms I understand.  DM me if you want a technical explanation and I will send you over to TWTR.

Thesis: Oil is one of the tools being used intraday to compress the VIX.  Central banks use various oil contracts intraday to control the VIX (but its only one tool; others are USD and the new VIX ETFs - SVIX, UVIX, etc. and the 1dte VIX options).  

I am not a graphic designer so excuse the simplicity of the following but I like to keeps things simple.

# Suppress Oil and suppress VIX - easy to see.

# In the above its easy to see why Oil is so important.

* If the Fed wants to support the market, it must lower inflation.
* To lower inflation, it must keep oil low.
* If it can keep Oil low, inflation stays low, interest rates stay low, the VIX stays low and the market goes up.

# The Fed has a problem:

* Inflation has been rising, and I dont care what the Fed says because I see it food prices, mortgage rates, everything.
* Rates have been RISING.
* The way to lower inflation is for the Fed to PULL money out of the system.
* BUT THE FED HAS BEEN INJECTING LIQUIDTY TO PREVENT THE COLLAPSE OF BANKS.  This is seen by the growth of the Fed's balance sheet:

https://preview.redd.it/pz11l2i4i10b1.png?width=355&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=823752471fdc609d08430af4c513b353f47e6120

The Fed's balance sheet grows when among other things, they lend more money to banks via the Discount Window.  They can do other things but this is the primary way.

Here's the problem and its simple supply and demand: 

# When there are more dollars (liquidity) chasing the same amount of product, the prices of the products rise (inflation).

# THEREFORE: the Fed should be pulling liquidity not adding if they are worried about inflation.  But they are not.  Why?????

These are the reasons:

1. If they pull liquidity then banks balance sheets will worsen and more banks will fail.
2. If more banks fail, then economies and countries will worsen.  Credit Suisse??
3. If countries fail, then the US has much less control over how those countries behave.
4. And if countries and banks fail, then the bankers behind both make a lot less money, or in some countries, they go to jail.
5. If bankers go to jail, politicians at the very least dont get reelected and at worse, they die.

# Ok, so now that we have the relationships and the possible outcomes, how does the Fed monkey hammer the oil market down???

**First, look at this chart.  The purple is the VIX.  The bars are oil.  Here's the last couple of months.  When Oil goes down, VIX for some reason goes down.  Pretty easy to see.**  

https://preview.redd.it/wng8og3xo10b1.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=bc794c173109e8265081bfaae55e61f01000d907

If the VIX goes up:

* Rates go up = BAD
* Market goes down = BADDER

# HOW ARE THEY DOING THIS?

1. Well the release from the SPR helped but there is only so much oil in SPR.
2. Through the oil futures market
3. Through the oil options market
4. Through the oil spot prices
5. With help from its friends Japan, Europe, the devil (JPM), etc. <--- they also use #2-4 to assist.

There you go.  An oversimplified explanation how oil is being used to suppress the VIX and why keeping the VIX low is so important.

Of course, as I shared, the Fed has many more tools to compress the VIX which supports the market.

* The Fed can print more money which has the effect of lowering interest rates which is deflationary. Less dollars chasing the same products forces the product prices down.
* The Fed can lend less money to banks - WAIT, NO THEY CANT BC THE BANKS WILL FAIL.  HAHAHA - Fed is stuck.
* The Fed can let the VIX rise and let the market fall, which is very devaluing.  NOPE, CANNOT DO THIS BC BANKS WILL FAIL.

The Fed is playing whack a mole - my bet is that sooner than later they fail.

# Bottomline: The Fed is stuck between supporting our economy, THEIR JOB, and saving banks that shouldn't have been saved in 2008 - $CS et al.  They are trying to do both but at the end of the day, they know if they let more BIG banks fail, then everything gets much worse.  Remember that Credit Suisse has $17 Trillion in derivatives.  If they fail, game over.

26,FRB vs PACW vs ZION vs WAL,DD,"I've been reading their balance sheets to see similarities and differences between the failed FRC bank and some of the ones still in the game: PACW, ZION, and WAL.

First, here are the balance sheets I've been looking at:

[https://ir.firstrepublic.com/static-files/013f57fb-b980-4353-bbb3-0e7a3b27f20a](https://ir.firstrepublic.com/static-files/013f57fb-b980-4353-bbb3-0e7a3b27f20a)

[https://www.pacwestbancorp.com/news-market-data/news/news-details/2023/PacWest-Bancorp-Announces-Results-for-the-First-Quarter-2023/default.aspx](https://www.pacwestbancorp.com/news-market-data/news/news-details/2023/PacWest-Bancorp-Announces-Results-for-the-First-Quarter-2023/default.aspx)

[https://zionsbancorporation.com/financial-info/as-reported-financial-statements/default.aspx](https://zionsbancorporation.com/financial-info/as-reported-financial-statements/default.aspx)

The first major difference I found is that **FRC had a massive 31b in held-to-maturity securities**. This category is special, because it allows banks to have massive unrealized losses without declaring it. By comparison, they had 18b in shareholder equity. So while they claimed their book value was $76 a share....that was BS. Also, there is a limit to how much banks can sell from their ""held-to-maturity"" category before they are seen as non-compliant.

Here's a comparison (I highly suggest you see the balance sheets yourself for more accurate figs):

*Bank - Cash - HTM secs - Equity - Total Assets*

*FRC - 13b - 31b - 18b - 323b*

*PACW - 6b - 2b - 2.7b\*\* - 44b*

*ZION - 705m - 592m - 7.3b - 69b (nice)*

*WAL - 3.6b - 1.3b - 5.5b - 71b*

*\*\* PACW actually already includes their unrealized losses as part of this figure. So by comparison to other banks in this figure, they have 3b+ in equity.*

So as you can see, by this metric there is quite a big difference between the failed FRB bank and the others. Much lower HTM secs, which result in more accurate book values. These banks aren't perfect, since they do have a good chunk of unrealized losses, but at least its not under HTM.

The other major difference I've found is of course, the percentage of uninsured deposits which I'm sure many of you already know. **FRC had only \~33% insured deposits**. Meanwhile, the other banks on the list have plenty of coverage for their uninsured deposits.

From what I've found on coverage for uninsured deposits:

PACW - 153% coverage, 73% insured

WAL - 158%, 73% insured

ZION - \~100%? (they don't specify, they just say they have ""enough""). 45% insured deposits.

&#x200B;

My position:

I had PACW, WAL, and ZION. I sold all PACW and WAL but bought PACWP and WAL-PRA, because I prefer the risk & reward there better, but still relies on banks surviving or liquidating with equity leftover.

I had ZION but I sold it as I was writing this DD after realizing they had 55% uninsured.

Currently:

5000 shares of PACWP

2000 shares of WAL-PRA

On two separate accounts for a total of 10k and 4k, respectively.

&#x200B;

TLDR:Banks still risky but market might be too fearful.

Let me know if I made a mistake above. Mainly posting this to see if you guys have some other banks you'd like me to look into. Let me know in the comments and I will DD them. Give me a nice flair if this goes well.",2023-05-15 17:53:09,7,">From what I can see, the main difference between FRB and the other banks is that FRB had a much higher percentage of uninsured deposits. This could be due to poor management decisions, or simply bad luck. Either way, it seems like the other banks are in a better position to weather any potential storms."

36,Volume tickers in play,DD,"Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

# Market-moving News

**Disinflation trend still in play which gives room for Fed pause in June.** The consumer price index (CPI) for April came in at 4.9%, slightly cooler than the 5.0% expected, and below last month's 5.0% reading. This was the smallest annual increase since April 2021 and the 10th straight month of improvement since inflation peaked in June of last year at 9.1%. Core inflation ticked down to 5.5% from 5.6%. While core inflation simply met expectations, the price increase was partly driven by a spike in used car prices. However, wholesale used car price dropped in April, so this decline may be reflected in retail price in May or June. Housing likely to decline as well given Fed’s lagging statistic method. What’s even more encouraging is the core services inflation excluding shelter (the so called “super core” which is largely a function of the labor market), improved meaningfully, rising by the slowest pace in nine months. Labor market, even though still very tight, showed sign of weakness as initial jobless claim jumped to a 1-year high. Below is the summary from this week’s news.

https://preview.redd.it/qev76jh0duza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3c100cb399891fc173932aa006d2641c9a53b505

**Both lending condition and demand deteriorated, and small business sentiment dropped to a new low.** SLOOS report released on Monday showed an incrementally tighter lending condition vs. Jan survey. However, loan demand also declined, especially in the CRE sector where buyer had the worst contraction in CRE loan demand in recent years. The reason for low loan demand included hard to get funding, cost of funding is high, low confidence in the economy (no interest in expanding or buying large assets). If credit condition tightening continues, it could be a recipe for recession, however, recent data showed lending actually improved in both large and small banks. Regional bank also suggested that they will continue to expand credit this year in their earnings calls. Plus, if loan demand is so low, losing some deposit might not be a bad thing (or even desired) as cash deposit is a liability for banks.  So what’s concerning is not lending standard but rather loan demand, which a net 55.6% of domestic banks reported declining C&I loan demand from large and medium-sized businesses, comparable to the levels we last saw during the GFC.

[Historically, when lending condition tightens sharply, hard landing follows](https://preview.redd.it/93650phgduza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=020957a1a6cb2fe4d26aad5ae67b3b1a0fda1460)

Small business optimism index hit a new low in almost 2 decades mostly due to soft measures (expectations) such as expected sales and earnings as well as inventory; hard measures (current condition) on the other hand is still steady such as current job opening and credit condition.

**Q1 earnings beat analysts’ expectation however companies experienced smaller-than-average price increases.** With 92% of S&P 500 companies having reported first-quarter results as of Friday, the proportion of S&P 500 companies that have beaten analysts’ earnings expectations remained slightly higher than usual. So far, 78% of companies have exceeded net income expectations, topping the 10-year average of 73%. On the other hand, companies reporting negative surprises faced larger price declines than usual. Overall, 46% of the S&P 500 companies that have reported a positive EPS surprise for Q1 have seen a decrease in price two days before the earnings release through two days after the earnings release while companies that have reported negative EPS surprises have seen a larger price decrease than average (4.1% vs. 2.2%). This market response cannot be solely attributed to the earnings outlook for the second quarter of 2023, as companies providing guidance have been less negative compared to previous averages. About 57% of S&P 500 companies issued negative guidance for Q2 2023, below historical averages.

**Regional bank issue persists and could get worse.** The acquisition of First Republic Bank's assets by JPMorgan Chase did not improve the performance of U.S. bank equities. Since the deal was announced on May 1, the S&P 500 Regional Banks Index has declined by almost six percent. Hedge funds, concerned about First Republic's issues and the lack of temporary deposit guarantees by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, have been searching for other regional banks that may face similar problems. This has led to short selling and added pressure on bank stocks, particularly those vulnerable to deposit outflows. Additionally, the tightening of lending standards by banks due to weak economic trends has compounded the challenges. Although federal financial authorities have the means to address potential issues, negative news about specific regional banks is likely to continue weighing on bank stocks and could impact broader market indexes like the S&P 500.

**The debt ceiling drama could get out of hands.** I still don’t believe US will default (never happened before), but that doesn’t mean the debt ceiling drama won’t create any volatility in the market. According to a study by RBC Capital Markets, the impact of debt ceiling deadlines on the S&P 500 varies based on market conditions and political factors. During calm periods with low volatility and minimal political risks, S&P 500 declines related to debt ceiling deadlines were modest, ranging from 2% to 7%. However, when the market was already anxious due to economic concerns and there was heightened political drama surrounding the debt ceiling, the market struggled, leading to declines of 10 percent to 19 percent. The most severe instance occurred in 2011, when the S&P 500 dropped 19 percent during a political clash in Washington over the debt ceiling. This nearly resulted in a crisis and the downgrading of the U.S. credit rating, compounded by fears related to the European sovereign debt crisis. I would say today’s market condition is getting closer and closer to a bad scenario.

# My positions and predictions

**US Equity Valuation**

After this week’s earnings reports, 2023 SP500 EPS estimation unchanged last week:

2023 Full Year EPS: $221

NTM: $230 ($2 increase from last week)

2024 Full Year EPS: $247

Current forward PE 18.0, lower than 5-year average of 18.5 and higher than 10-year average of 17.3. In terms of valuation, we unchanged from last week (18.0).

My investment thesis has not changed. Stock price is too high due to low risk premium:

If we valuate SP500 based on risk premium (10-year average at 3%), stock today should have a forward PE of 15.4, and given NTM EPS is $230 and 2024 EPS is $247, SPX should be at 3542 today and 3804 by year end (might be higher since T-bill yield is probably lower at year end).

I want to add a quick word on earnings. Q1 earnings have largely beaten expectations; however, overall, S&P 500 earnings are still 4.5% lower than Q1 of last year. Currently, analysts' estimate for 2023 full-year earnings remains the same or slightly higher than last year, primarily due to an anticipated 10% year-over-year earnings growth in Q4. In my opinion, this projection is overly optimistic. How can we expect a 10% earnings growth when inflation is only estimated to be 3.5%, while we are experiencing negative growth with inflation at 6-7%? This simply doesn't make any sense to me. I am still incorporating analysts' estimations into my model, but when I say we are priced for perfection, you can understand what I mean. Some analysts share my view, and below is an earnings estimation from PIMCO.

**My year-end projection (not changed):**

My base case (shown in green) has not changed from last week. Assume SP500 earnings of $247 for 2024, with inflation stabilizing under 4% and continuing to decline. The Fed pause after May hike and keep rate unchanged until year-end, before starting to cut in 2024. Year-end target is between 3920 to 4410 for SP500 based on 16-18X forward PE ratio.

Light blue box is where we are today. If we use 10-yr average forward PE ratio (17X), 3900 is a more appropriate level, and if we use risk premium model, we should be close to 3600.

If the current ""Goldilocks"" situation persists, characterized by a resilient economy and consumers, along with inflation reaching 3% by year-end, small- and mid-cap stocks, particularly those in the Small /Mid Growth style, could present an interesting investment opportunity. These stocks are currently trading at attractive valuations and tend to perform well in a slow expansion environment with low interest rates. But obviously sell everything when sign of recession appears.

* SPY closed down 0.25%
* QQQ closed up 0.66%
* Dow Jones Industrial closed down 1.11%
* VIX closed down 0.70%

Good evening everyone, I hope you all have had a relaxing weekend and are ready for market open tomorrow. The major indices continued to grind sideways/slightly upwards this week. This week we have jobless claims coming out at 8:30 am on Thursday and Jerome Powell speaking on Friday at 11:00 am. There are also some notable earnings reports this week such as Home Depot, Walmart, and Cisco, among others.

https://preview.redd.it/qr1pe08mwvza1.png?width=2270&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d93478d85601b2aba297c05da13f48702484eed4

SPY has been trading in a range bound pattern since the beginning of April. A positive is that price is currently sitting above the 50 day (green) and 200 day (white) [exponential moving average ](https://everydaytrades.com/moving-averages/)(EMA). For the smaller time frame EMAs, price has been fluctuating above and below. Range bound action can be difficult to trade since the exit signals are not always apparent. In a downward trending market, the signs to get out of a position are usually alot clearer.

https://preview.redd.it/9nz0bnomwvza1.png?width=2264&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=74f7ba57ee20773e8ba8268bf11768b61263b514

QQQ is behaving slightly better, indicating that we should focus on Tech/NASDAQ stocks. There is a clear upwards trend in the price actions and EMAs of QQQ. Although it would be nice for the pullbacks in price to be better supported by the 8 day (red) and 21 day (orange) EMA. Price can still whip back and forth considerably even though the overall trend is upward. Both SPY and QQQ are still telling us to be cautious, yet optimistic, in the market.

**ETFs To Watch**

https://preview.redd.it/b25ya48nwvza1.png?width=2266&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=98d2c2416e19b170c41cfa52199c1627e9dd1514

FDN is an ETF that tracks the largest and most liquid US Internet companies. There are several bases in this chart of varying lengths. The price action is constructive now that the current price sits above the 50 day and 200 day EMA. There was also some volume that came in on Friday and further support the price. If the markets start to advance there could be several buy opportunities as well as add on purchases.

GLD is an ETF that tracks the spot price of gold. GLD has a long weekly base that it approached 2 weeks ago but then sold off. This would be a good buy if there are continuing issues with banking sector. This could be an extremely powerful moving given how long the base is.

https://preview.redd.it/h9a5spfowvza1.png?width=2267&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2fa50cec514f8699f57cbfa1f39fe06430cd158d

XHB is an ETF that tracks U.S. home builders. This industry has had some good moves recently and this ETF is currently setting up nicely. It is forming a long base breakout and has price sitting above the moving averages.

https://preview.redd.it/lnbwagyowvza1.png?width=2256&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=507649a6f29c0d556d02437ee2c77e872024b376

XLC is a communications ETF with major holdings in META and GOOGL. It formed a cup with low handle several weeks ago and is currently approaching yearly highs. This ETF is being carried by bigs moves from GOOGL and META, so if those stocks move big this is going to do so as well.

https://preview.redd.it/i5v15qnpwvza1.png?width=2277&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f7635b95512f9cb36a72f4c713d88cc2f568b8a1

XLP tracks the consumer staples stocks and has formed a very long weekly base. Consumer staples are sometimes slower moving stocks and that is reflected in the ETF as well. There are some big names in this ETF such as PG, KO, COST, and PEP.

For all of the ETFs shown, it is a good idea to look at the top holdings and examine the charts of individual names. This may lead to better setups and faster moves than what can be reflected in the ETFs.

As always you should conduct your own research before making any sort of investment.

43,Will Tesla buy a lithium mining company?,Discussion,"There's this article from a few months ago.


https://www.mining-technology.com/news/tesla-sigma-lithium/

Only a few countries have large reserves of lithium like Australia and Chile. 

Chile is going to Nationalise it's lithium mining industry and only allows a few companies to operate there one being from the US Albemarle. This video on YouTube is interesting 

https://youtu.be/HSh6EgMwMOY

They recently opened up licencing and China is going to mine there too. 

There's only limited supplies of lithium and seeing as a smart phone only uses a few hundred grams of lithium in a battery and a EV uses about 40kg to 60kg per vehicle you can see that lithium is going to be in very short supply. China is the world's largest EV market so they'll devour as much of it as possible and aquire mines and resources for the EV market so also NIO will likely see a massive boost in value too in the coming years, the EV market grew 40 percent there last year and the Chinese can build the infrastructure nationally very quickly to support it... Not to mention their ramping up of renewable energy that requires lithium battery storage. Countries and organisations will start resource guarding lithium to ensure the viability of their companies and renewable energy growth.

We have Russia on the ropes, draining their manpower and economic power with this little proxy war in Ukraine, we’re still seizing oil fields in Syria, and we’ve got big problems in little China aka Africa. Geopolitically speaking, there’s too much shit going on for the powers that be to even think of defaulting. What we will do is go find more oil fields to seize, dictators to overthrow, and more guns, drugs, and money to trade using the CIA and some third world ass warlords. Can’t stop, won’t stop. Toby Keith might even write a new song. 

Any dip that occurs from this absolute steaming pile of bull shit is nothing but a buying opportunity.

50,Third time is a charm? Nearing the End - long post,Discussion," I haven't posted here in awhile mostly because I havent had much to say. But I think the next couple of weeks will be interesting. I hate people who waffle so here's what I am saying in case you don't want to read the long post: the VIX is going higher and the market is going lower and there is already evidence the house of cards is teetering.

I am not going to discuss the terrible breadth in the market, or what the VIX is actually signaling the market will do in the next couple of months (move in a 1% range), or the fact that we are being invaded at our southern border, or that the market returns are largely due to five stocks, or that CMG has a PE of 55, Salesforce 961 PE, Zoom 187, NVDA 162, or that earnings were terrible if you remove cost cutting measures etc. None of that matters either apparently.

# When will this tight range end?

Way back in February, I posted somewhat jokingly that what would drive everyone nuts is if the SP500 pinned itself to the 4000 level. Here we are in June and thats effectively what its done. I've posted about my frustration, my bewilderment and then my conviction that when it does break, it will be to the downside.

Whats important is not to take one or two data points and then deduct a result that is full of confirmation bias. However, I believe we are close - like next two weeks close - to this market being able to break out of this range.

A couple of points (thanks again to my expat genius on Twitter @/frankoz95967943 who learned me the very complex details of this) - all of these I have discussed at length in posts on my sub):

1. VIX is being suppressed artificially. I have covered how in previous posts. Simplest way to know is to look at HYG. It normally correlates. Not anymore.
2. Oil is also being suppressed. Again, if oil rises, everything else rises in price. The Fed does not want inflation. Best way to fight inflation is to keep oil down. I've shared how they are doing this in previous posts. (links at the end)
3. The Japanese are the major fbuddy helping the Fed do all of this.

I have to tell you that in +30 years in the market managing assets, I have not seen a market like this before. It is unnatural and controlled. That's why the VIX keeps dropping when risk keeps rising. I have posted at great length about the outlier risks that currently exist (Ukraine, banks, etc.) so no need to get into that again.

# WHY IS IT DIFFERENT NOW?

So a couple of things have happened and a couple are scheduled to happen that have caused me to go out on a limb and say this: what the Fed can control is limited and the end is near. Yes, the Fed can print money ad infinitum, like they have been doing, and the Japanese can play their role, but at some point, outside events will occur that they cannot control. Even with the help of the devil, I mean Jamie Dimon and JPM.

Here is what has happened recently:

# TRIGGER #1: OIL being manipulated is close to being out of US hands:

1. As I postulated earlier, because the US keeps hammering down the price of oil, eventually those countries whose GDP is based on oil might decide they've had enough. Well, OPEC+ is communicating they've had enough.
   1. [Saudi Minister Says OPEC+ Could Cut Production At Any Time | OilPrice.com](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Saudi-Minister-Says-OPEC-Could-Cut-Production-At-Any-Time.html)
2. Then there is this: [Iraq And Iran Ignore U.S. Sanctions In Talks To Expand Energy Ties | OilPrice.com](https://oilprice.com/Geopolitics/Middle-East/Iraq-And-Iran-Ignore-US-Sanctions-In-Talks-To-Expand-Energy-Ties.html)
3. There this: [Syria’s normalization signals a new Middle Eastern order (brookings.edu)](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2023/05/10/syrias-normalization-signals-a-new-middle-eastern-order/) <----- Let's not forget that Assad is a war criminal. So bad that the Arab league suspended Syria's membership in 2011.
   1. Of course, the NeoCons in the US govt respond by doing this: [US lawmakers introduce bill to combat normalization with Syria's Assad (yahoo.com)](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-combat-135934548.html)

The Middle East seems to be getting MORE peaceful, not less, Israel excluded of course. Why? I think its because they see that they have a shot at gaining more control over their regional politics AND perhaps a chance to wean themselves off of the US dollar dependance.

If the price of oil is allowed to trade freely, its going up. Period. If the price of oil goes up, inflation goes up.

# RESULT: If oil goes up, inflation goes up, and then the Fed will truly lose control.

# TRIGGER #2: DEBT CEILING TALKS

Lots of news lately about the debt ceiling. Of course the debt ceiling would not be a problem if the US just spent LESS but thats a moot point since thats not going to happen. I don't know if the US will default, probably not a full default anyway. BUT, the mere appearance of the possibility of the US defaulting will cause risk assets to plummet.

1. [Biden and Hill leaders postpone debt meeting as deal talks continue - POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/11/debt-limit-meeting-between-biden-and-hill-leaders-postponed-00096548)
2. [McCarthy was 'disrespectful' in Biden meeting on debt limit, sources say (nbcnews.com)](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/mccarthy-was-disrespectful-in-biden-meeting-on-debt-limit-sources-say-173870149509) \- what a bunch of children.
3. [McCarthy blasts Biden after White House debt ceiling meeting (axios.com)](https://www.axios.com/2023/05/09/mccarthy-biden-white-house-debt-ceiling-meeting)

Look, they will raise the debt ceiling at some point. The question is how long it will take and who will blink first. However, the longer it takes, the more nervous the markets become.

Don't forget this too: ***The Treasury General Account fell to $154 billion, down from $184 billion on May 9th. In fact, at this rate, the account will be EMPTY on May 19th. OPEX.***

Don't be fooled by the chatter of deals and more deals. Yes, a deal will get done but the point is the SP500 is not trading like there is any concern.

# RESULT: The empty TGA will force the US government to RAISE rates it offers to investors to fund operations. Raising rates is bad for the market.

# TRIGGER #3: SHORT SELLING BAN on bank stocks.

Beyond the hypocrisy of this, compounded by the fact that other than Yellen, the main spokesperson trumpeting this idea is the devil, I mean Jamie Dimon, is the fact that the last time they did this in 2008 after Lehman, 3 months later the XLF was down 51%.

1. [JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon wants US regulators to consider a ban on the short selling of bank stocks | Business Insider India](https://www.businessinsider.in/stock-market/news/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-wants-us-regulators-to-consider-a-ban-on-the-short-selling-of-bank-stocks/articleshow/100169845.cms)
2. [Calls to Investigate Short Sellers Intensify as Bank Crisis Deepens - The New York Times (nytimes.com)](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/12/business/dealbook/jamie-dimon-short-sellers-banks.html) <---short sellers as being blamed for bank failures - thats rich.
3. Oddly the SEC says nope.
4. TREASURY SECRETARY YELLEN TO MEET TOP BANK CEOS NEXT WEEK IN WASHINGTON: POLITICO <---- prob to discuss the $18b they are going to force on the banks to recapitalize the bank insurance fund.
5. Discussions of raising the FDIC limit to infinity <--- this is bank nationalization or rather, JPM et al.

# RESULT: A BAN WILL ONLY OCCUR IF ANOTHER BANK IS ABOUT TO FAIL - this is the only reason. IF IT OCCURS, BYE BYE MARKET.

# TRIGGER #4: MONEY IS LEAVING AAPL.

AAPL is close to an all time high. As AAPL goes so goes the market. AAPL's earnings S U C K E D unless you are a fan of gains due to outsourcing of labor overseas. Also, Foxconn, AAPL's largest supplier, reported a 56% drop in net income ( [Apple supplier Foxconn's Q1 profit plunges, outlook ""conservative"" | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-supplier-foxconns-q1-profit-falls-56-yy-worse-than-forecasts-2023-05-11/) ). Oh and Samsung Electronics profit fell 95% in first quarter. But yeah, AAPL is fine.

But while the stock is going up, money is leaving:

1. 2 billion left the stock May 5
   1. Money flowed in May 10th
2. Then this past Friday, 7 billion - and no its not repositioning or some other reason.

***Since Jan 1, AAPL has added $760,000,000,000 in market cap. Sure, that makes sense.***

# RESULT: AAPL rolling over will pull the techs and the rest of the market down.

# All it will take is FOR ONE OF THE ABOVE THINGS TO HAPPEN and the market goes down.

# But wait, thats not all. Here are some possible ""canaries in the coal mine"":

# The VVIX, which is the volatility of the VIX, is going UP when the VIX is being manipulated going down. HUH?

1. The UAE announced a $10 billion short position on US stocks last week. What's odd is how public this announcement was.
   1. I believe this was another warning to Washington to knock off their manipulation of the oil markets.
   2. Our government responded 2 days later that they would start buying to refill the markets in June. What?? Why would you communicate when you will buy in the open markets? The US has publicly stated they will only buy when oil is $67-$72 per barrel. Either the US thinks thats where oil will be or they are communicating to OPEC+ (the + is for Russia) that they will be done screwing around in June.

# OTHER RISK BEING IGNORED:

1. US Banks - not any better regardless of what Yellen and JP and the devil say. There is a structural problem with regional banks: they cannot compete unless they take on more risk and that has led to them taking on more risk which is why the banking system is set to collapse - collapse into a national banking system, run by the devil of course. I am not a conspiracy theorist - if you understand how much money the TBTF banks are getting for less than 1% from the Fed, you understand that regionals dont have a chance.
2. Ukraine - there is still a war going on. People are dying. The US public is done caring about Ukraine having moved on to better things.
3. China / Taiwan - probably not this summer since Taiwan is going to be having an election in 2024 and if the KMT party wins, unification, i mean war is called off: China wins, without a single shot being fired. By the way, this is the great idea our leaders Washington have if China invades: [US Threatens To 'Blow Up' Taiwan's Semiconductor Manufacturing Firm If China Invades The Island; Taipei Unhappy (eurasiantimes.com)](https://eurasiantimes.com/us-threatens-to-blow-up-taiwans-semiconductor-manufacturing/) WHEN YOU HAVE FRIENDS LIKE US...
4. Commercial real estate market is already crashing but of course, nothing to be concerned about
   1. Here's a jewel in San Fran that was valued at $300m two years ago, now on sale for the low price of $60m ( [Commercial real estate in SF grapples with 350 California's expected (hoodline.com)](https://hoodline.com/2023/05/smaller-commericial-real-estate-san-francisco-versus-350-california-expected-to-drop-over-80/)
   2. And this in NYC that was valued at $125 m two years ago just sold for $13 million ( [Turtle Bay Residential Building Sells at 90% Discount (therealdeal.com)](https://therealdeal.com/new-york/2023/05/04/failed-startups-turtle-bay-building-sells-at-90-discount/)
   3. CRE debt is a mess. I've already discussed it at length in previous posts. [Defaults on Commercial Real Estate Loans Surge to 14-Year High (investopedia.com)](https://www.investopedia.com/distressed-cre-loans-rose-to-5-2-in-february-7373644) <--- this was a January article.
   4. Trucking rates are WORSE than the 2019 ""Trucking Bloodbath"" when 10 large trucking companies went bk. Truck rates are down to $1.19/mile with operating costs up $.30 mile since then. This doesnt even include rising finance costs. (thanks to Craig Fuller@freightalley on Twitter).
5. Other items of interest are credit card chargeoffs higher than 2008 levels, rising auto loan delinquencies, poor tax collections, layoffs, BBBY bankruptcy (this would've normally crashed the market for a day or so due to their large real estate holdings). But yeah, there's no inflation.

# And really, the big data point to me that proves without a doubt the VIX is being manipulated is the following chart which shows that normally, like the last 15 years, when yields move higher, the VIX moves higher (historical R [correlation] of 71.21%). But not this time I guess. VIX is purple, Yields are green.

# CONCLUSION:All it will take is for one card to fall in this humongous house of cards. And I only listed a couple of them.

The US stock market is apparently not concerned. Since the VIX is sub 17 and headed to 0.

The FED is controlling what it can. They are running out of time and money.

The next two weeks are crucial and I have little confidence in Washington <--- they will screw up enough where they can't hide it.

# KEY EVENTS:

* OPEX this Friday
* TGA runs out of money - probably this Friday
* Debt ceiling talks get ulgier - already happening.

1. ***Celebration over universal*** *~~healthcare~~* ***FDIC insurance.***
2. ***AAPL sets a new ATH***
3. ***VIX collapses below 14***

**Disclosure**: I am LONG VIX calls from June to October. Heavy. Like 50%. In my 30 years, buying low VIX was a trade I NEVER lost money on. I trade options, daytrade ES and teach FOR FREE others how to trade (live trading on Friday). I am paying it forward.

## Trading Thee-sis 💅 - Why These Crayons Are the Tastiest 🖍️🤤

Darlings, back when I won Miss Mathlete, I discovered this fabulous way to analyze stocks. Technical analysis and indicator-based trading are so yesterday. They use past performance to predict today's prices, like trying to find the perfect lipstick 💄 by looking at last season's colors.

What I do is spice things up 🔥! I start with the current option open interest and whizz it into portfolio-level greeks (Delta & Gamma are *so* in vogue right now). Then, I simulate the change in greeks at different price points to find the *high-fashion* levels, where gamma is at its peak and delta is barely noticeable. Simply flawless!

Now, some tickers are extra sassy and react strong off delta-neutral or gamma-max, others strut off both 💃. It's these price reactions in the past that inspire my trading signals, darling!

The plays and target entry prices I serve are calculated using a binomial option pricing model 📊 to add that extra ""oomph"" to the gains💰. The best plays enjoy a double rise—directional moves and increases in IV.

## Notes - Tips for an En Vogue Trader 📝

* Listen up, sweetie: if the price moved past the entry price, be careful. Things may have changed since these plays sashayed onto the scene.
* Sell half of your position on a double and let the rest make its grand exit 💼.
* I casually risk 1% of my total capital on trades 💁‍♀️. Lower conviction? Oh, darling, just allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% and strut that dollar-cost average!
* The trades were calculated pre-market open so they're *so* yesterday. Keep an eye on today's trends before making a grand entrance too late. 

## FAQ - Inquiring Minds Want to Know 🕵️‍♂️

* Mostly puts, are you a bear?🐻
   * Darling, no! 💁 Some stocks are just a little *too* fluffed up lately, so these plays are all about the mean reversion—think liposuction! 💉
* Are you playing all the trades yourself? 🎲
   * No, sweetie. I'm presenting a fab menu of plays for you to choose from! Pick the ones that make your heart sing and rake in the gainz (and fame!) 🌟
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker. What gives? 🔄
   * Ditch the old one, darling! Jumping into the new play is like updating your wardrobe for the new season 🛍️—you deserve the latest and greatest.

# Background

On the afternoon of April 28th I was pondering how my cheap FRC 65C 5/19 purchased a week before could have gone so wrong when I remembered something from listening to the entire audiobook of Security Analysis (1934): Companies are valuable by assets they have or profits they can generate. An asset-rich but unprofitable company can potentially be turned around, or liquidated at a profit if share price falls low enough. An asset-poor but profitable (or soon to be profitable) company will become wealthier as long as dividends are not too high. FRC was a puddle of toxic financial waste that was losing money every quarter from assets that were net negative in value (deposit / asset mismatch) and the FDIC had to fill in 13 billion for JPM to take the deal. The earnings that came out on the 24th made it very clear there was no way to get some kind of positive value out of the company for anyone. I bought 1P 5/19 at 45 cents, which sold the next week after receivership for 80 cents and made me slightly positive on the whole ordeal.

PACW is a regional bank in a precarious state. They are next in line after FRC in terms of sentiment, stock price collapse, and news of deposits fleeing. They are [drawn in to Burry's chart in scary red letters](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11ub295/michael_burrys_chart_for_banks_with_regard_to/) which is obviously very bearish too. However, they are in at the 60% uninsured deposit / 35% unrealized CET1 losses zone which is far lower than (redacted <500M bank), Silvergate, and First Republic. Regional banks are now literal reverse meme stocks where volatility and sentiment can cause the deposit outflows that cause asset-liability mismatch and kill the bank's profitability or even solvency. PACW's 2031 bond is 40 cents on the dollar, showing severe lack of confidence in their survival. Without a surprise injection of capital or sudden rate cut, their outlook is gloomy until enough of their loans renew at a higher rate and/or rates go down enough to take pressure off their interest margin, probably sometime in or after 4Q 2023. They are also trying to sell their Lender Finance arm for 2.7B but it seems to be taking a while to close. The common dividend was cut last week from 25 cents to 1 cent, which was actually pretty well received on Monday, but the effect didn't last, and the dividend was announced late on Friday night. They announced they were looking at ""strategic options"" which seemed to have a mostly downward effect as they're clearly looking but haven't made a deal. They are certainly still a solvent bank, but how much should the stock be worth, and what happens if more deposits leave?

# Analysis

PACW is still generating a profit from their deposits, but it has shrunk as deposits left and interest rates rose. Another lesson from Security Analysis is to remember who gets paid and in what order: bonds, preferred shares, common stock. Usually companies are either profitable and everyone gets paid or fail and the bond holders fight over the scraps, but sometimes it can land in the middle. I'm going to focus on the common stock. Here is the current situation from yesterday's 10Q:

&#x200B;

|Description|Value|Note|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Q1 2023 earnings available to common|80 million|In the 10Q they have some goodwill impairment thing going on that makes Q1 look like a massive loss, this is after ignoring that and some layoff costs.|
|Q1 2023 earnings for common annualized|320 million||
|Number of common shares|123 million|200M authorized|
|Price at 10x earnings for Q1 2023|3.2B, or $26/share|The stock was around $27/share in February|
||||
|Mar 31 Net Interest Margin|2.89%|This is the majority of their revenue. The margin drops as they lose low-cost deposits. Down from 3.43.|
|Mar 31 deposits|28 billion|Down 5.7 billion (16.9% in Q1)|
|Mar 31 uninsured deposit %|29%|Down from 52% on Dec 31|
|Mar 31 uninsured deposits|8.12 billion||
||||
|May 4-5 deposit drop|Down 9.5%|Holy shit bro they lost 10% in 24 hours. tbh I'd leave if I was uninsured too.|
|May 10 uninsured deposits|5.2 billion|Losing 9.5% of 28B entirely from 8.12B uninsured would be 5.46B remaining, but they probably lost some in April too so the numbers aren't exact|
|May 10 immediate liquidity|15 billion|If the rest of the uninsured deposits panic they can cover it at least, although it means more asset-liability mismatch|
|Deposits if all uninsured leave|20.12 billion|Mar 31 - 9.5% - 5.2B|
|Reduction in deposits times reduced NIM|\-229 million|(28-20.12)\*-0.029. This is the loss to yearly revenue from yield on deposits.|
|Earnings for common with above reduction|91 million or 22.75 million per quarter|Worth nothing this is 18.5 cents per share quarterly. That 25c dividend isn't coming back.|
|**Price at 10x earnings**|**910M, or $7.4/share**|**This is around the recent peak. This would be what the price would stabilize to after a few months.**|
|**Price at 5x earnings**|**455M, or $3.7/share**|**I found some old paper that said during the GFC banks were valued at more like 5x earnings. This is also the recent low.**|
||||
|Insured deposit outflow required to wipe out common earnings|\-3.5B or remaining insured deposits 16.62B|Assuming all uninsured deposits also leave. It is the remaining earnings for common 91M divided by 0.026 (a reduced NIM).|
|% Drop from current estimated 25B deposits to wipe out common earnings|\-33.5%|Basically, if they lose another 1/3 of deposits the stock is only worth the possibility of future recovery.|
||||

Kind of freaked me out that the analysis came out close to the recent high for the optimistic case and recent low for the cautious case. It's all priced in???. I decided to focus on the earnings available to common since that's where the option plays and massive swings are. The preferred stock is paying a 20% dividend if that's your thing, but know that if they lose profitability on the common the preferred follows very soon after.

Graham and Dodd would tell you to seriously consider the bonds or preferred shares too since they get paid first and a near-certain 40% is much better than an unlikely 3x. I don't have access to good bond data so I would appreciate if someone can explain why their bonds are trading at 40 cents.

For the common stock, Graham and Dodd would insist on a considerable margin of safety for any purchase. Probably in the $2 - $2.7 per share range, if at all with the risk of further deposit flight and receivership. They would probably also look at other regional banks like WAL that are in the crosshairs but have stronger positions and leave PACW alone until their future became more certain.

&#x200B;

# Conclusion

I have seen generally bearish sentiment about PACW as bullish as the general sentiment about FRC the week before earnings, in some cases even switching to being a PACW bear to make up for FRC losses (wrong inverse dummies, the weaker banks fail first). So I do expect some loss porn with short strike puts as well as some overly optimistic calls. Also, if PACW falls below $4.06/share (500M mkt cap) then we will not be able to discuss it anymore lmao.

There seems to be a mismatch in that there is still a demand for loans from these regional banks but not enough interest in deposits to fund those loans. The model of 5 - 30 years loans but deposits that can leave anytime doesn't work with rates rising this fast. That could mean a massive liquidity crunch in real estate loans but that's another topic entirely and maybe even wouldn't be a bad thing long term if it corrects commercial / multifamily RE prices.

The risk and amount (per share) of potential loss is significantly less with a low entry point, so perhaps sell CSP at $3 or below. All things considered, this is a very borderline bank and its survival basically hinges on the insured depositors sticking around, very slow rate hikes or a rate cut, and no further major unrealized losses to the assets.

# Positions

My positions: I am holding a ""don't know shit about fuck"" spread. Only started with options last week so positions are small until my hubris grows. IBKR is on maintenance or something so no screenshots, but here it is from memory.

|PACW 100 shares @ 6.1 purchased May 10.|
|:-|
|Short 8C Jan15 2025 @ 2.98 sold May 10 (buy write with the shares).|
|Long 3P Sep 2023 @ 1.4 bought May 12 (receivership insurance lmao)|

On May 10 I figured ""Either they're fine and they will surge past 8 and I get to collect $300 premium + $200 profit when I eventually get assigned, or they're going to take a while to recover but at least I'll have a $3 cost basis when the call expires in 19 months"". The put is because I got spooked by the potential for a weekend FedDICking and wanted to get the put before any Friday afternoon dump, I plan to hold it until July-ish.

I am still confident in my long position although I would certainly not buy in at $6 again.",2023-05-13 20:55:58,36,That's too much reading. IDK anything but YOLO like an idiot and FRC 2.0

Use these like any indicator, with caution. Basically gives you an understanding of when we start going into oversold or overbought territories.

1. This is much more useful for index-related products like qqq/spy/iwm/dia because they're likely to see less volatility in relation to individual tickers.
2. With earnings, market participants are placing more options-related bets causing implied volatility to go higher, so this expected move information can help dictate the range in which a stock moves. Obviously, if there are unexpected poison pills in an earnings report or if there are unexpected positive catalysts, you can move outside the deviations.
3. it's expected that 70% of the time we fall within the range by the end of the week/month/quarter. So this means that when we are hitting the upper and lower bounds of this data, we can see oversold or overbought conditions. Now here's where you can pair it together with another tool called RSI. Most people are familiar with RSI. If we break out of the upper expected moves on already high RSI, this can create favorable short setups where you do have probabilities on your side. Now keep in mind point 1 & 2 that I made. You can have overbought + high RSI on individual tickers like MSFT and NVDA because of something that may fundamentally change the company like a new revenue stream. Hence why this is more useful on index-related products.
4. At the end of the day, this is all a game of probability. When you are oversold on RSI, and you're several deviations outside the expected move, probability favors the upside. When you are overbought on RSI, and you're several deviations outside the expected move, probability favors the downside.",2023-05-14 01:13:26,9,Nice creative graphing. Crayons are much better.

As we gear up for another week, let's take a look at the economic calendar, specifically focusing on Monday's lineup. At 8:30 am Eastern Time, we begin with the release of the Empire State manufacturing survey for the month of May. A slight chill might run through the market, as the median forecast is currently pegged at a less-than-optimistic -5.0. This is a dramatic swing from the previous 10.8, indicating a possible shift in the manufacturing sector.

However, the day's events are far from over. Concurrently, the Chicago Fed President Goolsbee will make a televised appearance, promising a rich discussion and invaluable insights into the current economic landscape.

Finally, the morning's agenda concludes at 9:15 am with a presentation from the Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari. His remarks are always keenly anticipated and will certainly provide much fodder for market analysis. So, as we embrace the new week, stay tuned for a Monday filled with informative and potentially market-moving events.

**Daily Chart**

Bears failed to close under 408.87 and the gap at 408.64 - 402.72 remains protected. We have liquidity at 414.89 and a gap at 414.77 - 415.27 that bulls will try to overcome this week. A close above 415.27 opens the door for a liquidity grab at 417.62 and 418.31. Bears need to take out prior day low at 408.87 for the 408.64 - 402.72 gap fill.

Bears swept the previous day's low at 409.97 and grabbed liquidity at the order block from May 10th. Buyers came in with increased volume. We saw a character change at 410.70 and swept liquidity at 411.58. We have resting liquidity above at 412.01. On the late bounce, bulls created a fair value gap at 410.47 - 410.80 and 410.39 - 410.27, currently holding as support AH. On the way down, bears left a few fair value gaps at 412.40 - 412.52 and 412.93 - 413.16 that bulls will look to fill on Monday. The current price action favors the bulls here.

As you can see that we are currently in the sell side premium as we are below the 50% retracement at 411.67. Shorting at the current price doesn’t look attractive to me.

**1H Chart**

Bulls came in 170.69  - 171.14 order block. We have a change of character at 170.67. Close under the character change on the hourly, and price action will favor the bears to test buy-side discounts. We have liquidity sitting at 169.00 with buy-side discounts at (50%) 168.62, (62%) 167.18, (70%) 166.23, (79%) 165.15, and (100%) 162.54. We have a 166.34 - 165.08 order block and 166.34 - 166.70 fair value gap within the buy side discounts that could offer some support. Be mindful that we have equal lows that could get swept at 162.66. 

We found resistance at the 176.14 - 174.10 order block as we put in equal highs. We have untapped liquidity within the order block at 176.15. Above 176.15, and we have an order block at 177.99 - 179.60

https://preview.redd.it/bfcyawgqteza1.jpg?width=271&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e2c3fd134baab3fed1ae393bbacd880d384adc34

THE 10 GOLDEN RULES OF TRADING

I've been in the option business for a very long time and you cannot learn the skill of trading overnight. To be a master it takes years and TBH, I certainly cannot claim to have mastered options, but I do know them. When you do progress to becoming a consistently profitable trader it can be a very rewarding experience and I have learned along the way that there are certain rules that need to be adhered to. Some, you may think are obvious but I can tell you, I have seen other people break every single one and everyone will likely have done at least one of them at one point, if you end up doing this long enough...

1. MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS!

Do not enter a trade just because someone else told you to! Do your own research, you need to know everything about the trade you are entering,

2. ALWAYS TRADE WITH A STOP LOSS OR MAX LOSS IN MIND.

Before you enter a trade , already KNOW what you are prepared to lose on it and it should ALWAYS be less than you are hoping to make. (I would suggest as a guide that your loss should be no more than 50% of what you are hoping to make. Your stop loss can either be set based on technical, events or based on your affordability. It should basically reflect the loss that you are willing to accept to lose on a position. Irrespective of whether you are trading on the long side or on the short side, always you need to have that level where the position is just wrong and you need to have that discipline to exit a loser. (The only addendum I would add to this is that with equities or futures, you can put in an electronic stop which once placed, takes out the emotion of having to exit yourself, however, I would advise not to put it (stop-loss) in on an electronic platform option strategy, because it will likely get triggered when it shouldn't have due to liquidity. In this instance, if you have a system that can evaluate your option position at any given time, you will be able to see where the value is, so just know where your stop-loss level is and if your theo value gets there then you have to have the discipline to get out.) Which brings me to...

3. DISCIPLINE!

Do not move your stop-loss. If it gets triggered, accept it and walk away. The same can be said for booking profits. Profit is what is booked; all else is book profits. Keep taking your money off the table at regular intervals. There is NOTHING WRONG with making a profit. YOu may see something go further afterward, but that's fine, you have MADE MONEY and that's all that counts. I personally would use a trailing stop, which moves up along with my profitable trade.

4. NEVER LET A WINNING TRADE TURN INTO A LOSING ONE.

As I mentioned above, I have used a stop that moves up with my winners (eg; I book the profit if it retraces 10% off any recent high if it hasn't got to my target) but once clear and in the money at the very least put in a stop that will get you out for no loss.

5. NEVER CHASE/ADD TO A LOSER

Do not add to your position if your position is losing and you cant bear to take a loss, this is not a winning strategy. If your strategy is to average into a trade over a price range then that is totally fine, but doubling down in the hope the market will turn will burn you to the ground eventually.

6. DON'T LOOK BACK IN ANGER

This is very important especially if you have had to book a loss. Traders tend to look back and over analyse. Also, when traders book profits and the stock goes further up, they tend to look back at the notional losses. Both are not advisable as they tend to detract from your core trading strategy.

7. DON'T OVERTRADE/TRADE OUT OF BOREDOM.

Not trading is also a strategy. This is something most traders tend to miss. Traders believe that trading strategy either means to buy or to sell in the market. But the most productive strategy can be to not do anything. This is very relevant when the market is very confusing and traders can get hit either way. Have your own plan and STICK TO IT!

8. COSTS SHOULD BE CALCULATED INTO YOUR STRATEGY

Remember, when you trade your cost is not just the brokerage you pay. There are all kinds of other charges like stamp duty, turnover tax, exchange fees etc. If you take delivery of shares, there are also expenses related to your account. The point being, that I know of traders who have grossed over $2mil at a firm and seen every penny of it eaten up by costs. And then there is margin. For all of you options and futures traders and anyone else who trades on margin, you should have a good understanding of how changes in a position may require more money to maintain them, even if they are doing well. All these costs and how margin changes (how much capital you'll need to maintain the position) over time need to be factored in when you project your trading profits and entering the trade.

9. BE AWARE OF OVERNIGHT RISK

Decide on a strategy that you like and stick with it market. Positions are normally intraday or for a few days. One of the biggest risks you need to be conscious of if the overnight risk. When there is uncertainty on the economic or geopolitical risk or there is a major event coming up, it is always advisable to be as light in the market as possible or at least understand what you really have at risk if things go pear-shaped but you're not there to do anything about it.

10. STAY ON THE SIDE OF MOMENTUM

When you are a trader, trend is your friend. You are more likely to make money as a trader if you trade according to the momentum. Trying to short a bull market does not make sense. Similarly, trying to catch a falling knife is also not the right idea. You trading strategy should be aligned to the direction of the momentum.

Remember that there is NO WISHING, HOPING OR PRAYING. This isnt a game, you are here to make money. Decide on a strategy that you like and stick with it. If you stick to rules, learn from your mistakes, be humble and respect the market and you will become a successful trader.

87,"Too late to be long but still too early to be short… Welcome to the Pain Range… 5-12-23 SPY/ ES futures, DXY, 10YR Yield and VIX Weekly Reca",DD,"Well at this point I think people think I am a permabear… however, I really don’t have a bias in this market and if you watch me trade intraday you know that I easily play calls and puts just as much… though I will say puts pay far better in this current market then calls ever do… But like my heading says “its too late to be long but its still too early to be short.” Someone posted this in a comment and it really hit me that its exactly how I feel in this market. 

Let me explain… going into this week I was fairly confident in a hot CPI which would have bene the bearish catalyst for no rate cuts, no pause and another 25bps rate hike in a month at FOMC… however, that did not obviously happen with that “cooler” CPI print we now find ourselves just barely scraping by from a market sell off… however, as this EOW price action would suggest we don’t quite have the upside pressure bulls should have hear to take this higher. 

We truly are in an extremely painful spot in this market… theta and IV crush is hitting like no other… there is no trend and there is absolutely no continuation. We are so far in my opinion overbought that I find it highly unwise to go long (plus I truly believe this market is literally scraping by on fumes and one of these days is going to let go) however, we clearly are being held up by big tech that its very unwise to go short… so what are we left to do here? Well first off ALWAYS remember CASH IS A POSITION! But honestly this is a day traders dream as we have some pretty solid movement that is really setting up for some nice intraday plays. 

I truly looking at the technicals (Which I will cover below) believe we are about as close to the top of this trend as we are going to get… however, we haven’t gotten the signals and flashing red lights that its time to go short… for now its time to play the range and wait for us to pick a direction…

On tesla Daily here we got a lot going on.. so I was VERY much so bullish EOD yesterday and was looking for the pump… the tesla ceo news caused the pump to the 173.98 targets I was looking for. Now this is where you gotta remember “buy the rumor sell the news.” What actually happened is that this huge pump put in a huge high volatility bearish day…

This is what we have right now is a bearish engulfing daily candle (4 day long actually), a failed breakout of this downward channel, and a closure back under that 168.57 demand which is the daily 8ema… this was a massive failed breakout and with this rejection a new supply at 172.27 was put in… that means our target is now the 160.87 supply. We also have bearish daily IV and with bearish price action. We also loss the red support line which was a 3 point touch… 

My ultimate target for next week is 160.87 (-4.3%) with an extreme target of 153.8 (-8.9%). 

I took a half sized 167.5P 7dte put play for this… looking to hold till at least 160.87. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Well until the EOD pump (a classic for SPY) I was actually thinking we might finally see SPY rebalance itself by closing under that 411.15 supply. However, we actually closed back over that supply so as of right now we still would be considered imbalanced. So this still either needs to close under 411.15 OR attempt to turn 411.15 into demand (support). As of right now we are in the process of discovering our next demand (support). However, I do not have a true target for that yet. 

It is extremely difficult (on spy at least) to find where this wants to end up… Our biggest support targets are 404.3 to 405.06 and resistance is 415.56 to 417.03. 

**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iyjwb80ktgza1.png?width=969&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0b8b6e1a0ac27a30fe6d7a1fea2a08f4a4f05305

The weekly supply/ demand chart actually is the one thing right now that makes me VERY bearish… one of the indicators I use (I do apologize I can not share it nor can I discuss the interworkings of it) has officially finally signaled a BEARISH weekly reversal… what does this mean? It means that we finally have reached a place where the technicals are supporting further downside. 

Spy weekly did close below that 411.87 demand (support) that does open up a chance for a drop to at least the weekly 20ema which is 404.03… a bigger retrace would be to the 385.9 or 385.21 demand. However, outside of a black swan I would be shocked to see us go that low… most likely scenario is a retrace to the 390-400 area where we could actually establish a new higher demand (support) in order to propel us back to the 412-416 area. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2ctge0hktgza1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=92dda5fb47b3ed2ffed0b0dd7106a2ddde1ee838

This daily trend is straight barcode… no other trend to be had here… WE actually for the last 6 trading days have CLOSED within the same $2.99 range… that is a very tight range. 

The most bearish thing I can take away from this is that we now have a 3 point touch blue resistance line and did lose the support of the blue 3 point support… this opens up the potential to touch the support line for the bigger black rising wedge. That support sits at 408.2 for Monday. However the biggest bullish thing I can see here is that we have now for 3 trading days in a row bounced off the daily 20ema and closed over the daily 8ema. 

With this bearish engulfing daily candle and rejection off resistance/ losing support I would personally favor downside with a target of 408.9.

**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/red74ovktgza1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7a28c030558af3dedbacf44bfaebfc8c546743a8

A completely uneventful weekly chart here… we are still closing within the same $4.35 trading range for the 5th week in a row and we are still in that bigger $9.7 range for the 7th week in a row…

Now this rising wedge is about to come to a finally support test… 410.61 is that key weekly rising wedge support. If that line breaks then that would in my opinion indicate a bigger sell off is about to start. WE also have a nice carrot top (v-top) forming here too. We actually have an extremely tight breakout/ down triangle here on SPY weekly with support at 410.61 and resistance at 411.78. 

One very real scenario here is that we are going to see a fake breakout/ down and continue to range here.. I still personally would not be going long or short until minimally this $4.35 range is broken. 

SPY Weekly Levels  
 Supply- 416  
 Demand- 411.9 -> 385.9  
 Support- 411.6 -> 407.1 -> 404.4  
 Resistance- 416 -> 422

**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Now this daily futures chart actually shows a much different story… we actually today with this sell off managed to reconfirm 4153 as a KEY supply/ resistance. This supply is so important and strong that I actually am going to highlight it with a different style line… we did managed to close under the 4135 demand (support) too. With this 5 closures between 4133 and 4154 finally being broken there actually is a bigger chance of a sell off here… 

Our downside target would be 4074 on any major sell off. However, our upside target would be 4154 then 4190/4198 IF we managed to have a hefty bounce Monday. 

**FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6bhuc70mtgza1.png?width=798&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=80b9641de08918ee043f64a6be6d065d820a47ae

The futures weekly chart also shows bearish reversal conditions now too… I would have liked to see a closure under the weekly 8ema but we did retest 4173 supply (resistance) on the weekly and to the point rejected it. Our target still once again remains 4054 on a weekly time frame. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/crgugsemtgza1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4541ef8b83ab0f34e78411d81d76e15b5081e442

The futures daily chart does make me feel and want to be far more bearish then SPY… We did manage to close below the daily 20 and 8em and closing under that 4134 support area. One other thing is that we perfectly rejected that blue resistance line making it a 4 point (extremely strong) line to watch. We also lost that 3 point support line. The final support now is the black rising wedge support at 4105 on Monday and the blue resistance would be 4160 on Monday.

Futures weekly in my opinion is showing a far different and far more bearish chart then SPY… what I am seeing here is that we are now closing below that month long range support of 4138. We did attempt to close under the weekly 8ema however, that eod push up of course stopped us from doing that… 

Our breakout triangle support is 4125 and resistance is 4140.

One thing I have highlighted here is that the 7 week post JPM collar (quarterly) roll is next week… now what USUALLY happens on week 7? Well usually what ever trend (Currently bullish) we are in will see a sizeable retrace from weeks 7 to week 11… 

Now when we keep in mind that there are perfect spy/ futures weekly bearish reversal conditions and that our breakout/ down triangles are coming to a point we very well might finally be seeing the top of this market… IF you believe in historical trends this is our opportunity to short. One thing to keep in mind is that occasionally week 7 will be the peak and the retrace doesn’t happen till week 8… I have a bigger target of 4000 for futures if this trend was to hold true… So far this trend has been a solid one to watch since 2022. 

**VIX**

Tough trend here on the VIX as we actually broke through both support and resistance of the short term triangle… so we redraw that and re-evaluate next week… we are seeing that this 16.8 area is becoming a major support area… WE did once again fail to break through 17.72 though.

We should watch these two key levels for a direction… I will say from a volatility/ iv/ price action stand point I am actually seeing further downside on the VIX for now… 

**10YR YIELD AND DXY**

The biggest thing I have said im watching for is the DXY recovery and 10YR breakout… we have part one which is the DXY breakout and holding that breakout… the last step is for the 10yr to breakout…

We are truly about as close to the top as we arguably are going to get… the signs are not 100% aligned yet… but there are a lot of things aligning that a sizeable correction is inbound.

Last week I put in my best week of profits for 2023 and I was 100% not trying to chase those gains as I know that is how people put themselves in a really bad spot and start taking poor trades and not securing profits… well after a very painful Monday and Tuesday I was able to secure my now most profitable week of 2023 again. 

Today was a great day of trading that I couldn’t have been any happier with… I have really struggled the last few Fridays of trading but I was able to with this range finally adapt to it and truly exploit it. 

After a terrible February… I have now put in 5 green weeks in a row and have been green for 8 out of the last 9 trading weeks. 

This market continues to be an extremely difficult one to navigate but everyday that SPY throws us a curveball and these markets do something new and unpredictable is another day we are learning and becoming better traders… Remember everything we learn now in this terrible bear market is information we will use to become that much more profitable traders in the next bull market.",2023-05-12 21:05:46,79,Too early to be short?

93,Unveiling My $132k PLTR Trade: Leveraging Anomaly-Detection Strategy and Greek Moons,Discussion,"The trade was focused on PLTR and employed an anomaly detection strategy. In addition to my usual analysis, I integrated a novel tool - the Greek Moons.

**Background**

On 5/5/2023, I invested in 8.00 call options for PLTR set to expire on 5/12/2023, at $0.20 per option. A week later, on 5/12/2023, I sold these options for $1.52 each, bringing in a total profit of $132,000.

**The Data**

The successful execution of this trade depended on an anomaly detection strategy that harnessed the following data:

* Daily PLTR Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume
* 20, 50, and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA)
* Stochastic Oscillator (%K and %D)
* Greek Moons data
* VIX Gamma High, Low, and Spread

**Key Insights & Anomaly Detection**

The linchpin of my strategy was identifying market anomalies, unusual patterns often signaling substantial price fluctuations. In this instance, the anomalies were pinpointed using Greek Moons, an advanced tool that aids traders in detecting unusual options market activities.

The Greek Moons tool averages Greek values based on expiration and moneyness and shows the rate of change daily. This information was pivotal in predicting an unusual move in PLTR. On 5/5/2023, the Greek Moons data, coupled with PLTR being below its 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day SMAs, indicated a potential oversold condition. The Stochastic %K was also in oversold territory, adding further support to the potential for an upward price movement.

By 5/12/2023, PLTR's price had risen substantially, allowing me to sell my call options for a significant profit. The Stochastic %K had also moved into overbought territory, suggesting that PLTR's price might start to retreat, thus strengthening my decision to sell.

**Deep Dive Data**

The subsequent data shows a detailed view of the market variables and indicators that led to my decision to trade on the specific dates:

**Conclusion**

This example demonstrates how unconventional data sources, such as Greek Moons, can complement traditional indicators in making trading decisions. It's important to remember, though, that past performance is not a definitive predictor of future results. The nature of the stock market is unpredictability, hence the importance of diligent research and a careful assessment of risk tolerance.

95,Asset Bubble,Discussion,"So this is a thought I had, and fellow regards please excuse the following discussion for perhaps being too serious. 

QE, since 2008 has effectively led to an explosion is equity and asset prices. The availability of low interest, nearly 0% interest rates for institutions has resulted in countless sums of money being pouring into the real estate and equity markets. What the true value of these assets, at least in my mind, remains unanswered. With higher interest rates, the fed continuing to reduce its balance sheet, and the U.S debt ceiling being regularly reached, QE has turned into QT.

The last instance that I can remember regarding such a turn in monetary policy is the Nikkei bubble that Japan experienced in the 80/90s.

Given the after affects of the pandemic, the real estate frenzy, the moderation in real estate prices, and current market conditions, are we seeing something similar?

**The Fed**

Fed’s Bowman “Should inflation remain high and the labor market remain tight, additional monetary policy tightening will likely be appropriate to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance of monetary policy to lower inflation...”

University of Michigan inflation expectations in May were mixed. The 1-year expectations (blue) eased slightly from 4.6% to 4.5%. On the other hand, the 5-10-year expectations (orange) increased from 3% to 3.2%, reaching their highest level since March 2011. I don't think the consumers are really feeling the disinflation yet.

As I have mentioned a few times, government spending and Fed's special lending facilities greatly compromised if not reversed Fed's QT operations. The Fed's liquidity drainage campaign has, thus far, largely failed, which has been beneficial for US equities.

**The Economy**

April import Price Index for the month showed a 0.4% MoM increase, slightly surpassing the expected 0.3%. The Import Price Index excluding Petroleum experienced a minor decrease of -0.1% higher than the anticipated -0.3%. Export showed a 0.2% MoM increase, aligning with the expected 0.2%.

However, looking ahead into May, In several of my previous post, I mentioned contracting economic indicators, including trucking and freight, commodity prices, and weak PMI in China and the EU in April, suggested a continued disinflationary trend globally. These factors could likely influence the import/export data for May, reflecting the overall economic conditions and the impact on prices.

**The Business**

Bank of America's Michael Hartnett says it’s not yet time to buy equities as outflows accelerate amid elevated inflation and recession fears.

"".. we’ve seen these post crisis rallies before, but a crack will come this year. Buy the first negative payroll print . .. $SPX up 11%, Nasdaq up 15% in 2 months after Bear Stearns Mar'08; .. just as then credit & tech lead a 10-week rally ..""

The S&P 500 has not experienced a weekly move of more than 1% in either direction since the week of March 27th. This situation is reminiscent of 2015 when the market remained relatively flat for six months before crashing 10% in a single week. The market is stuck between a rock and a hard place, with high inflation levels and signs of economic contraction. If the inflation is too sticky, the stonks are fucked (higher rates), if the economy contracts too much, the stonks are also fucked (recession). But so far, none of any of that happened. So, turns out I am the one who is getting fucked.

But according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, Microsoft remains the stock to buy as it maintains its lead in AI with its stake in ChatGPT and prepares to start monetizing the opportunity.

""The AI monetization opportunity makes us more bullish on \[Microsoft\],"" he said in a Thursday note. ""We believe that Microsoft is in a unique position to gain share in the cloud market while deploying additional AI capabilities that we estimate could expand Redmond's total addressable market around cloud by 35% to 40% over the coming years.""

The company's strategic stake in ChatGPT, which was bolstered earlier this year with an additional $10 billion investment into OpenAI, could set Microsoft up for the opportunity to start taking share in the cloud space from Amazon's AWS offering. 

Ives reiterated his ""Outperform"" rating on Microsoft and said it remains a ""best idea."" Additionally, he increased his price target on Microsoft to $340 from $325, representing potential upside of 9% from current levels.

While Alphabet continues to play catchup in the AI space, it is setting up to go head-to-head for market share against Microsoft, especially as the search company has indicated that it plans to incorporate AI capabilities into all aspects of its product suite, including the cloud.

117,Leaked Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Request - Microvast DOE Grant Application - Oshkosh USPS NGDV Confirmed?,DD," TL;DR: Oshkosh confirms Microvast is supplying batteries and separators for NGDV for USPS in leaked FOIA FOIA DOE grant application with GM. This is the beginning of the next leg up, get in now and fill your bags before the news is released. 

Now the details..  

GM and Microvast recently won a grant from the Department of Energy (DOE) as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, which rewarded 200 million dollars to Microvast to build a factory in the US with GM support, to produce an advanced separator using IP from both GM and Microvast.  See here for more details: [https://news.gm.com/newsroom.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2022/nov/1102-microvast.html](https://news.gm.com/newsroom.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2022/nov/1102-microvast.html)

Recently Microvast had a great earnings, beat expectations on margin quarter, raised guidance, enhanced margin.  This led to a more then 50% gain in one day, and a bit of a short squeeze as many many people and institutions have been shorting Microvast into the ground and were caught off guard by the quarter's results.  Check out the chart and volume last 2 days.  Based on the limited move, there are still many shorts that have yet to cover, and interest is way up.

I believe I've identified some leaked information that will light the fuse on this rocket now considering the context that it finds itself right now.

This fuse is a leaked Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) dump that is the redacted joint application with General Motors and Microvast for the grant for their new factory to build advanced battery separator technology.

In this 240-page leaked redacted grant application to the Department of Energy (DOE) there is a boatload of very material information that has never been seen about the separator and the technology and the company.

In addition, there are several letters in support of Microvast applications from companies that have committed to purchasing the separators and other batteries from Microvast.  One of these letters appears to confirm that Oshkosh is in fact using Microvast batteries and separators for the USPS NGDV.

While you can read through the entire thing here:  [https://file.io/Xl1g1p2oqi7K](https://file.io/Xl1g1p2oqi7K)

I will focus this post on the Oshkosh / USPS / NGDV confirmation.

First here is a screenshot of the letter (page 149) in the leaked FOIA DOE grant application (please read the whole thing but notice the language circled in red):

We have a chance here to get in before this information is confirmed and made public.

Edit:. This also suggests that a US supplier being used is the goal especially for US Government or government adjacent organizations.

What are Carl's options to fight this? With the Feds investigating IEP and shorts continuing to pile on, he will need to do more to directly address the concerns of shareholders and right the ship. Carl's a Wall Street legend, so if anyone can fight off a coordinated short attack, it's probably him. But he is in a very tricky financial situation. Thoughts?

128,Volume tickers in play,DD,"Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

Things to consider when finding the plays-

·       If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day. 

·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.  (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.) 

·       The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move. Some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed.",2023-05-12 12:04:18,10,">Thank you for your question. I believe that technical and fundamental analysis are both important when finding growth tickers.

A company called ECOLabs ($ECL) is going to go up. 🚀💰📈.  I believe their semiconductor sector speculation isn't priced in, and neither is their public works projects.  Bill Gates is invested.

# 1. Intro

Welcome to the ""It Takes Tinfoil to Make Tendies"" series.  A collection of speculative plays based on research and varying levels of speculation that I am presenting.  I believe America is making some wild power plays to maintain dominance for the next century.  I wanted to write it all at once, but it started getting so out of hand I had to cut it down to smaller parts.  This one is specifically about $ECL.  I'm not an expert, but I do like low-risk high reward plays, and I am a patient hunter.  I am offering this DD so that people can ride into the future on something more solid going into a rough seas market while they can gamble lotto tickets on other shit.

I've been grinding my gears looking for a way to take advantage of the U.S. Chips Act ($280 Billion) and the Green Chips Act ($10 Billion), the E.U. Chips Act ($150 Billion), and the Korean Chips Act ($450 Billion).

At this downward point in the market it is good to start setting a concrete base of solid long-term plays (2 years) instead of trying get rich quick plays like meme-coins and companies going bankrupt.  ""Millionaires are made in Recessions"" as they say.  So I started snooping and found this company, and began digging more and more.  There are really two different angles here that I will discuss.  The semi-conductor portion and the water treatment portion.

[The Trick Is To Let Them Cook](https://preview.redd.it/7bdstuxty8za1.png?width=588&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1d5a780e8093b29400bb0370e67ea97ff139bba4)

# 2. Water and Chips

The massive amount of money being poured into the semi-conductor industry led to me the American Southwest where they are expanding and building two enormous top of the line facilities so that you can have your iPhones, and Chinese children can stay employed, and several other expansions. [Intel, TSMC, NXPI, Samsung, and Texas Instruments (and more) are all striving to have American Chip Production and they have all chosen the second driest spot in America to do it](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/new-us-fabs-everything-we-know).

&#x200B;

[It Was There That I Started To Question About Water](https://preview.redd.it/jjd9lxo1z8za1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=634f3decb684e2cd20e3ba996da106988f41f952)

What strikes me as odd is the location of these new facilities despite the insatiable thirst of Chip Foundries.  Making semi-conductors is a very thirsty task.  To create an integrated circuit on a 30cm wafer, can require approximately **2,200** **gallons of water**; including 1,500 gallons of Ultra Pure Water (see below).  So a large fabrication facility (Fab) that processes say, 40,000 wafers a month, can use up to **4.8 million gallons (18169976.6 Liters) of water per day.** T**his equates to the annual water consumption of a city of 60,000 people (Gary, Indiana if people are thirsty).**

wow. numbers man... crazy.  Well, let me show you in pictures how much water that is.  If I could make this into a pop-up book, I would.

&#x200B;

[FINA Olympic Sized Swimming Pool](https://preview.redd.it/0xmsfyz3z8za1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=882f8fffeca837e1d1703d7ca466ebd5fedbd90d)

This Pool is 6.56Ft deep (2 meters) and it is regulation size.  It holds about  660,000 US gallons.  Which means, that for a large facility, you would need  7.3 of these fuckers full of water **a day** (copy and paste this image 7.3 times).

In a tropical climate, such as Taiwan,  droughts can bring production to a screeching halt.  Global warming or whatever has hit a few times already and affected the great supply chain of TSMC.  The new facilities being put in Arizona are enormous by the way.  Pretty sure you'll be able to see it from space, and [the Water Wars are already starting](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jan/27/arizona-scottsdale-water-cut-off-rio-verde-foothills-drought?ref=upstract.com).  I could probably find a library of articles about water shortages, but I'll let you do that.  Hell, if you can find me an article saying water shortages are **not** going to happen I would be grateful.

So, why do they need so much water?  A semi-conductor is a miniaturized electronic circuit containing a multitude of transistors. Water is fundamental to the manufacture of semi-conductors because over a series of steps, semi-conductors are built in layers on silicon wafers into integrated circuits (also called microchips). After each one of several dozen layers of semiconductors are added to the silicon wafer, it must be rinsed, requiring massive amounts of water.  But, it's not *just* water. It's Ultra Pure Water.

[Ultra Pure Water (UPW)](https://semiconductor.samsung.com/support/tools-resources/dictionary/purity-on-another-level-ultrapure-water/) is thousands of times purer than drinking water. Water so clean, that it is regarded as an industrial solvent. To make 1,000 gallons of UPW takes roughly 1,400 -1,600 gallons of municipal water.  The standard for UPW was 2PPM (Parts Per Million), now, it's <0PPM, and as chips get smaller and more sensitive, the restrictions will be in the lower PPB.  No solids, no biomes, no silica, no ionization, not even trapped O2 or CO2.  From a chemistry standard, This water is so pure that it could wash the sin off of me in my college years. Impressive.

So, what does it mean when ""they use a lot of pure water"". It doesn't mean they take this and throw it down the drain.  There are some harsh chemicals used and flushing it would be a total waste.  They recycle it.

This is where Ecolabs comes in. Specifically, their offshoot group [NALCO](https://www.ecolab.com/nalco-water).  Nalco is into water treatment, conservation, and automation.  See where I am going with this?  Brief bit of history is that Ecolabs bought Nalco back in December of 2011, Bill Gates became the largest shareholder in August 2011.  I am sure this just lucky coincidence. Ecolabs paid 5.4 billion dollars at  $38.80 per share.  It has pretty much been forgotten about.

If you look up $ECL description on RH it says (>!Slut\_!<Spoiler Alert: >!it doesn't mention semiconductors!<):

I actually saw an earlier job description stating semi-conductor processing, but I didn't save it and it's gone now.  Trust me bro.  I saved the hyperlink though if you want to use the wayback machine.  [https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726](https://jobs.ecolab.com/job-not-found/?jobid=17553726).   I think they want to keep the details ""water-tight"".   This is not well known knowledge because ECL isn't ready for show-time yet.  The Plants are still being built.

If you are wondering about the ""Data-Center"" I'm sure they mean the Microsoft data center ""US West 3"" in Arizona.

The future of NALCO is a ghost on the price of $ECL stock.  This is a sneaky play that hasn't gotten into the revenue stream of ECL yet because these foundries are not online, but they will be soon. Very soon.  When they do, **I THINK** the automation systems, chemical services, operations and maintenance, waste water treatment,  carbon emissions, water monitoring, etc... will make $ECL chart move up.

The best part is though, you don't need to read the financials to feel warm and fuzzy about investing into $ECL.  Bill Gates has done it for you.

# 3.  William Henry Gates III

I don't know about how you choose your plays or sleep at night not worrying about stocks.  My sleep-aid of choice is alcohol, chamomile,  and making sure someone smarter than me agrees with my thesis or plan.  If you snoop around long enough into ECL, you will find a lot of work with Microsoft.   This isn't a surprise as the [largest share holder of ECL is Bill Gates himself](https://www.barrons.com/articles/bill-gates-ecolab-stock-51660936071).  He first began buying in 2012; bought again in 2018, and again in August 2022.  Billy knows a LOT about the  semi-conductors industry cause he co-founded the company Microsoft, of Windows Vista™ fame.

***Tinfoil Hat Zone level 3/5:***

>I know I am getting a bit off topic, but I just thought I would give some insight into the big picture that I am feeling in my crystal balls (boating accident).  Bill Gates is working on the greatest play on earth: bringing water to the desert.  Just like Las Vegas. Just like LA orange groves.  Taking a bunch of desert dirt cheap land, and terraforming it into a sustainable garden using the government to heavily subsidize the land with public/private works using global warming, energy scares, drought threats, the security threat of oversees chip manufacturing, and [anything / anyone else he can use](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/environment/water-restoration-arizona.html).  It's the oldest trick in the book. Water infrastructure mean water, water means population, population means taxes, taxes means money for the government, government pays for more water infrastructure.  He is essentially a Bond villian looking to transform America into his vision of the future.  Luckily that means money moving in and out of publicly traded companies, and that means we can snag some.  
>  
>Bill Gates being the largest farm land owner in America really helps him find all that good clean aquifer juice.  With wells already dug and everything. What Luck!  It would be unfeasible to use surface water or desalination plants.  Even to make salt water drinkable isn't cost effective, let alone make chip-grade holy water.  Typically even fresh surface water like rivers aren't used to cleanse.  They are used to dump waste water into though.

>The top land per state is:

1. Louisiana
2. Arkansas
3. Arizona
4. Nebraska
5. Washington

>That's 4 wet states, a desert state, and the state famous for corn and ""Carhenge"".  I believe he intends to use this land to control the closest to natural pure water and therefore semi-conductors life blood.  Does it sound like I am wearing a tin-foil hat suggesting that water would be shipped or trucked miles from where it originated? Is that something a crazy person would say? Is it? Well, let me just take a sip of this Fiji™ water bottle I bought at a gas station 18 miles off the freeway exit in Huron, CA.  Awww much better. I can really taste the Fiji!

I believe that Bill Gates intends to get a significant return on his investment, and that hasn't happened yet. Some say it's because of his devotion to fight for ""[global warming](https://twitter.com/goddeketal/status/1655658051855065090?t=0fqTNBwM8Q2B5HNU86b4Aw&s=19) causes"", though I'm not sure which side of the fight he is on.

The major undeniable fact is that he has bought a shit ton of land through Cascade Investments in west phoenix where he plans on housing the smart graduates from the university of Texas, and any defecting Taiwanese engineers.  Someone will need to mow their lawns, brew their coffee, educate their kids, clean the offices, etc...  What he wants to do: [Smart City](https://www.facebook.com/worldeconomicforum/videos/10154914651546479/) of all the links I have running through this DD, this is the one you need to watch.  I want a piece of that, and I know water conservation will be a big part.

# 4. The Stock

At the end of the day, the last 4 transactions of Bill Gates have all been buys, with a cost basis of $172.25. Source: [Ecolab (ECL) Insider Trading & Ownership](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/ECL/insider-trades/).  Last Buy was August of 2022.

Currently, ECL is trading at $173.67.  Wish it was cheaper.  If you check out the WallStreetBets reddit talks, or the new discord, I have been saying it was a buy since $160 and verbally talking about why I am bullish.  Something about having a lower cost basis than Bill Gates makes me feel smarter and therefore better than him, and you could have that opportunity too soon.  You will see that on May 5th 2023 The CEO sold quite a bit of shares at $173.48.  Probably for taxes.  Probably...  Possibly because a big dip coming next week with liquidity crunch warnings in the macro economic sphere, the old song and dance with the debt ceiling, the FOMC 5 bps raise correction, the bank contagion spreading, ""in may go away"" chestnut etc...  In these times it's time to start looking at what is going to work out, what is safe, and think about selling that start-up venture capital company at a loss.

I like this article too showing double digit growth despite the macrotrends.

NALCO is saying that the claims are without merit.

# 5. Water Treatment and Sanitation

The other side the EcoLabs business is water treatment and sanitation.  Their bread and butter.  Soon, you will begin to notice just how many products say ""EcoLabs"" on them.  Soap, detergent, disinfectant. Also municipalities for industrial water treatment etc... etc... It's always good to have a fallback steady revenue of products when you are expanding into a new-ish sector or high demand customer contracts.  Basically, $ECL is a utility company, which rank #1 on the defensive stocks you want to own during a recession and yes they have dividends.  Ask your boomer Grandpas for confirmation on this.

As other countries begin industrializing such as India and Brazil, water treatment and sanitization will have a growing demand, and the Bill and Melinda gates foundation already has a foothold in these regions.  There is also lobbying in select areas of America to take groundwater purification a step further.

Currently, water is treated with traditional methods of chlorine, sunlight, flouride, reverse osmosis, etc.  The municipality promises that every harmful bacteria is dead until it gets to your tap.  After that it's free game.  However, a growing concern in heavy populated areas is the presence of hormones, drugs, heavy metals, and fertilizer run off aka atrazine aka gay frogs.

Things like birth control, steroids, adderall, prescription medication all go through your body and exit it down the drain and run off to the low grounds.  There are lobbying groups trying to get cleaner groundwater and better waste treatment.  It's all about the control and efficacy of water.

Recently, chemical spills have been wreaking havoc across the country.

&#x200B;

[The Carpet is Ohio](https://preview.redd.it/v1wpsj2jz8za1.png?width=456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=048c43d0ebf93b9217bbe20a238279c76773fdb5)

Some people say the media is just now paying attention to how many chemical spills and explosions happen, others say it's increasing in frequency. [Holy Shit](https://preventchemicaldisasters.org/chemical-facility-incidents/).  Just like Bill Gates had an investment in [vaccines](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/23/bill-gates-turns-10-billion-into-200-billion-worth-of-economic-benefit.html) pre-covid, he has an investment in water treatment pre-train wrecks. Can you believe this guys luck?!  The chemical spills and media attention may (will) be the start of a  campaign of water treatment policies and water infrastructure, which is actually well overdue.

As for the plays, it's shares below Bills recent buys, and call options in summer.  To prove this is a solid play, they options chain is relatively weak, and only go out to October. hoping for an announcement that these large chip manufacturers are partnering up with NALCO for water-based control.

133,"Following up on my prior post, undeniable proof that Pacific West absolutely was LYING",News,"To summarize what happened.

On May 3, Pacific West [issued a press release](https://www.pacwestbancorp.com/news-market-data/news/news-details/2023/Pacific-Western-Bank-Issues-Update/default.aspx) stating that all was good.

On Friday May 5, at 10pm,  [it said it would cut dividends](https://www.pacwestbancorp.com/news-market-data/news/news-details/2023/PacWest-Bancorp-Announces-Quarterly-Dividends-c1460fd7b/default.aspx) from 25 cents to a penny, but again that all was good. That prompted my [post asking](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/139kgyk/last_night_at_10pm_pacific_bancorp_cut_its/) if it was lying, because the 10PM timing of that release sure did seem suspicious, not to mention its ""all is good but oh we're cutting dividends any way"" content.

Now, in their [SEC 10K quarterly filing](https://www.pacwestbancorp.com/sec-filings/public-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=16642121) \-- that they filed late last night -- the truth comes out. It states that, ""\[d\]uring the week ended May 5, 2023, our deposits declined approximately 9.5%, with a majority of that decline occurring on May 4th and May 5th."" **So on the night of May 5th, at 10PM, they knew that in the preceding two days, their deposits had fallen by 10%.** The failure to disclose the deposit outflow was IMHO a lie and it probably cost some poor trusting bank bulls money this week.

This time we found ourselves in a $2.46 throughout the day… we did actually end up having a decent amount of volume at 70mil as of writing this… We have officially closed our 4th doji in a row and our 8th doji out of the last 9 trading days… 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

https://preview.redd.it/j8d3wtmzv9za1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cc629619c33c3daa82c40ac7d59f6bba51e7eb03

We still find ourselves in this same range and we have not been able to breakout of it for over a month now… 

We still are imbalanced for now as we are closed over the previous established supply without making a new demand… currently the way price action reads is that if we are able to establish a higher closer tomorrow we actually could establish a new demand (support). However, honestly right now we are in the chop zone and there is absolutely no direction and i feel fairly confident when I say if anyone is playing a long or short then its just a guess… 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4ngfep30w9za1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fbc2e56e4e931279028a328b81b638b117a46dcb

On SPY daily we actually have two major patterns to watch… the first is the black diamond pattern and the second pattern is this blue breakout/ down triangle. As of right now key support tomorrow is 411.24 and key resistance is 413.7. If one of these levels breaks we could be eyeing a much bigger move in that direction atleast until the diamond support/ resistance is tested and broken. 

As of right now we are riding the support of the daily 8ema which should and could allow for further continuation to the upside… but as you can see much like intraday now we just are finding new ranges to trade within and we have no continuation to the upside or downside. 

From a weekly stand point of view… bears want a minimum close under 411.87 but really under 409.5 (weekly 8ema), however, bulls would prosper most with a closure over 416 minimum. 

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 411.1 -> 415.6  
 Demand- 405  
 Support- 411.9 -> 408.9 -> 408  
 Resistance- 412.8 -> 414 -> 415.7

**FUTURES SUPPLY AND DEMAND** 

&#x200B;

Pretty similar story here on futures as we are now wedged right between the 4153 supply and 4135 demand. Favoritism would go for a new supply to be confirmed and possibly if we get a bigger red day tomorrow we could re-establish 4153 as supply (resistance) which would be extremely bearish… 

However, if we break out tomorrow there is a chance we could push up to the 4190/4198 supply area and attempt to establish a new higher supply before coming back down. 

Currently we are in the process of finding the next supply (resistance). 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

Futures also turned its 4th doji in a row in today… however, we have a slightly different structure with a rising wedge but inside of that we are eyeing a real nice breakout/ down triangle. 

Key support is 4134 and key resistance is 4165. Whichever one of these targets is broken we should expect a continuation of that into next week. As of right now there is a pretty equal weighted case of dumping through 4134 and breakout through 4165. The technicals really do support both. This double bottom off 4134 with a follow up double top off 4153 would give me a bearish bias for tomorrow. However, this 4134 and 4153 levels are both extremely strong and important. 

From a weekly stand point the bulls want to see this close minimally over 4192, however, bears would be cheering for joy with a closure under 4137 but ideally under 4128. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4153 -> 4190  
 Demand- 4135  
 Support- 4134 -> 4110  
 Resistance- 4153 -> 4180 -> 4192

**VIX**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h6enjyj1w9za1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=45fc4761c0a060e7c5630978cf6c209dbdb0c8f2

The VIX continues to fight right about this 16.96 (call it 17) area and that has been a major support area for the last 4 trading days, however, we have now attempted to turn that into resistance. If this is the VIX turning 17 into resistance then the favoritism would be to the downside not the upside here for VIX which would give a bullish push up to SPY. 

I am not too worried about the white falling wedge as that is not a super strong line yet… however, this red support line which makes a real nice breakout triangle for this blue falling wedge is one to watch… that support lies at 16.65 tomorrow… IF we lose that support then I would see this as a bear flag for the VIX which means the VIX likely heads back to the 15s next week and SPY up to the 415-420 area. 

**10YR YIELD AND DXY**

Now if you have been following my posts for a while you know the one thing I am watching for is tech to sell off… why? Because every single sell off for really the last 2-3 weeks has been led by the tickers in SPY/ DOW not by the NASD… so until tech finally shows weakness… we are stuck in this trend… one of the biggest things I am looking for is the breakout strength recovery of the DXY… as of today we FINALLY broke this two month long falling wedge… now this might be a failed breakout… however, as you can see by the curling upward EMAs.. this is looking like a heavy consolidation before a move to the upside… I will be watching for a move over and closing over the 102.196 area… IF and when that closure happens that should signal a breakage of the consolidation and move to the upside…

DXY regaining strength finally should take tech down finally… 

We might into next week see TECH start its sell off… 

The 10YR yield has not quite recovered yet and continues to show weakness and is just basing in this 3.306% to 3.607% area.

**The Fed**

Initial jobless claim jumped to 245K much higher than expected and highest since Oct 2021. Initial claim claim increased slightly to 1.8MM. 

https://preview.redd.it/a6fdil5jz9za1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0f5308cd21ba78401b1614f89e20a2bfd80af421

However, from a historical perspective, total jobless claims currently represent only 1.24% of the entire labor force. Historical data shows that recessions typically begin when jobless claims at least 2% or more. Therefore, the current level of jobless claims is not yet a cause for concern. 

https://preview.redd.it/8618f1f10aza1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=030d4b5ae908fab1c3b1ec63eabbb29d7ff452f9

We will likely to see initial claims continue to climb in the coming months as historically rate hikes leads initial claims growth. Fed is not going to be concerned at this level and probably welcome a slightly loose jobs market.

COMERICA: “Jobless claims show a small margin of slack is opening up in the labor market .. the direction for unemployment is very likely higher over the next six months .. The Fed is more likely to start cutting interest rates later this year than hold them unchanged into 2024.”

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released April data showing that the Producer Price Index (PPI) for final demand rose by 0.2 percent, lower than the anticipated 0.3 percent. This follows a decline of 0.4 percent in March and no change in February. On a year-over-year basis, PPI increased by 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in April. The slowdown was primarily driven by a decrease in demand for energy (-8% YoY) and transportation & warehousing for goods (-5.1% YoY).

Note that CPI is higher than PPI by 3%. Corporates are making good money on expanding margins. The inflation will last as long as people can still afford it.

More government spending coming than Fed can roll off their balance sheet. Bullish for stonks.

The consumer debt delinquency rate is increasing, although it remains below pre-pandemic levels. However, the rate is rising rapidly. Nothing to worry about now but definitely worth to keep an eye on.

**The Business**

Google has added over $100 billion to its market capitalization after unveiled new AI-centered features tied to Gmail and Workspace as its annual developers conference, Google I/O. 'AI' was mentioned over 140 times in its 2-hour Google I/O keynote. That's over 700 million dollars per ""AI"".

PacWest stock plunged 23% after it said it lost 9.5% of deposit last week. They actually reported no deposit losses on May 3rd but the stock selloff scared the depositors and they lost 9.5% in 2 days (May 4-5). Like I mentioned in the weekend post, there is no rational in fear. This kind of self-reinforcing deposit outflow will likely to continue from one bank to another.

However, banks today maintain significantly higher levels of liquidity compared to pre-pandemic times and even during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). As long as there is no substantial decrease in the value of collateral assets  (like what happened to T-bills and office loans), the banking system remains fundamentally strong.

I added a couple of ""Small Growth"" stocks (with a strong cash balance and lower PS ratio than before the pandemic) to my portfolio today (ZS and DDOG). As I have mentioned a couple of times, I think these stocks can thrive in a slow growth low interest rate environment. My other positions have not changed.

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
* **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-12.
* **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""
* **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

Advocates argued before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday that granting legal protections from federal drug laws to banks that serve cannabis dispensaries and related businesses allowed under state laws would cut down on crime and tax evasion.

“Forcing legal businesses to operate in a cash economy is terrible for accountability, but it’s great for crime,” said Senator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat who sponsored the SAFE Banking Act. “It has left these businesses and all that are connected to them open to violent crime, open to money laundering, employee theft, tax fraud and more.”

189,My lotto play for DIS's earnings tonight,DD,"Disney is reporting it's fiscal second quarter earnings after the bell. I'm wondering if the media conglomerate can keep regaining its mojo with Disney shares up +13% year to date to top the S&P 500’s +8%.

Here are what analysts expect:

* Earnings per share: 93 cents per share expected, according to a [Refinitiv](https://www.refinitiv.com/) survey of analysts

* Revenue: $21.79 billion expected, according to Refinitiv

* Disney+ total subscriptions: 163.17 million expected, according to [StreetAccount](https://www.streetaccount.com/)

They're expecting a drop in Disney’s second-quarter earnings per share compared to the Q2 2022 EPS, but with Q2 sales up from the prior-year quarter. Investors will be hoping that Disney can post another better-than-expected quarter on its bottom line and show a consistent illustration that the company is working in the right direction to elevate its profitability margin despite what is still a challenging macroeconomic environment for most companies. 

Notably, Disney easily surpassed its Q1 EPS expectations by 43% last quarter. The earnings beat was driven by a 21% YoY increase in the Parks, Experiences, and Products segment revenue at $8.7 billion. This led to shares of DIS spiking more than 5% before cooling down and drifting lower in the following weeks. Certainly, more sustainability in Disney’s price movement after reporting its Q2 results is at focus in hopes that this year’s rally can be extended.

Beyond day-to-day operations at the company, we're going to expect Bob Iger (CEO of Disney) to address a number ongoing challenges. On Monday, Disney expanded its [federal lawsuit](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/26/disney-sues-florida-gov-ron-desantis-alleges-political-effort-to-hurt-its-business.html) against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, accusing the Republican leader of doubling down on his “[retribution campaign](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/08/disney-lawsuit-against-desantis-expanded.html)” against the company by [signing legislation](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/05/desantis-signs-bill-to-void-disney-development-deals.html) to void Disney’s development deals in Orlando.

Additionally, the company is already [seeing rippling effects from the ongoing writers strike](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/08/hollywood-writers-strike-halts-stranger-things-severance-production.html), including the production shutdowns of Marvel Studios’ “Blade,” which was set to begin filming in Atlanta next month, as well as the Disney+ Star Wars series “Andor.”

**IGER & Cost Cutting**

In regard to Disney increasing its margins, Iger returned to the helm of the company last November with the initiative to reduce expenses and sustain growth and profitability.

During its last quarterly report and Iger’s first back as CEO, the Disney boss announced the company would cut thousands of jobs and reduce its capital expenditures by $5.5 billion. To the delight of investors, Iger stated the cost-cutting initiatives will make it possible for Disney’s board to approve the reinstatement of its dividend by the end of the year. We expect a third wave of layoffs within the company announced soon.

**Streaming Growth**

Like streaming competitor Netflix (NFLX), Disney will no longer provide guidance for subscriber growth. With that being said, Disney’s ability to add subscribers during the quarter will be at the forefront of its Q2 results.

Specifically, Wall Street is eyeing Disney+ after the streaming service lost 2.4 million subscribers during Q1 amid subscription price hikes and increasing competition from big-name tech stocks like AAPL, and AMZN. This was the firstly quarterly loss since Disney+ was launched in 2019. Still, a wider loss was expected among Disney+ subscribers last quarter with Disney topping estimates by 3%.

Disney+ had 161.8 million paid subscribers during Q1 and 234.7 million total subscribers when including its ESPN+ and Hulu services. While Disney’s total paid subscribers topped Netflix’s 232.5 million paying members, the company’s Direct to Consumer segment reported a -$1.1 billion loss during Q1 up from -$0.5 billion in the prior-year quarter.

Disney stated the increase in operating loss was due to a higher loss at Disney+ and a decrease in results at Hulu although there were improved results at ESPN+. Direct to Consumer revenue did increase by 13% YoY during Q1 to $5.3 billion.  

Improvement in operating costs among the Direct to Consumer segment will make Disney’s stock much more attractive. Longer-term investors are hoping that Disney’s growth among streaming services will eventually lead to massive earnings potential for the company.

**Earnings Expected Move**

Looking at the implied volatility of the options market in Disney, we can see the weekly expected move for the rest of the week is ±$3.55 - about 3.5% of the stock’s notional value. This is not too high of an expected move for an equity, but it is about 77% of the expected move through the June options cycle 39 days away from expiration, and over 50% of the expected move in the July options expiration cycle. Based on this information, the market is placing a lot of weight on Wednesday's earnings report, given the high implied volatility in the weekly cycle relative to further-dated cycles.

With DIS stock trading at $100.70 (at the time of writing this), we can go to equidistant out-of-the-money (OTM) strikes to see if there is a difference in premium, or skewed premium. Looking into the option chain, in this case, the calls is trading for a bit more than the puts, both 5 points OTM from the current stock price. This tells us that Disney’s options market has call skew in the weekly cycle. This indicates that a high velocity move is being priced into the upside – this does not mean the stock is going to go up, but the market is pricing in the risk of a high velocity move to the upside just slightly.

**What to do For Disney Earnings?**

I looked through the last 5 years of movements with earnings, the stock moves on average 4 ± 3% after the earnings report. With this said, it might not even be worth getting calls or puts because the premium prices are pricing a move that's very very similar to this percentage. However, given everything I've looked at, I want to get puts. DIS 5/12 99p is 2.03. However, I'll be inversing myself because of the WSB Cramer tag and will make big money with a call spread. I can buy the DIS 5/12 102c for $241 and sell the 105c for $140. This means I can grab the spread for $101, and potentially make 3x gains.

Original Source:

https://www.reuters.com/markets/us-watchdog-says-it-found-unacceptable-problems-with-chinese-company-audits-2023-05-10/

WASHINGTON, May 10 (Reuters) - A U.S. accounting watchdog found unacceptable deficiencies in audits of U.S.-listed Chinese companies performed by KPMG in China and PricewaterhouseCoopers in Hong Kong, the government agency said on Wednesday.

The U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)published the findings of its inspections after gaining access to Chinese company auditors' records for the first time last year following more than a decade of negotiations with Chinese authorities. That access kept roughly 200 China-based public companies from potentially being kicked off U.S. stock exchanges.

The deficiencies were so great that auditors failed to obtain enough evidence to substantiate companies' financial statements, PCAOB Chair Erica Williams told reporters on Wednesday. The firms, two of the so-called ""Big Four"" in accounting, represent 40% of the market share of U.S.-listed companies audited by Hong Kong and mainland China firms, she said.

PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in Hong Kong said it is working with the PCAOB to address issues raised and noted the inspection report marks an important milestone for U.S. and Chinese cooperation. KPMG's firm in China said in a statement it has taken steps to address the issues the PCAOB had found.

While the findings are consistent with what the agency usually discovers when gaining access to a foreign country's audit records for the first time, they will likely raise worries among global investors over the accuracy of U.S.-listed Chinese companies' public financial statements.",2023-05-10 19:01:18,122,Color me surprised...

195,Volume tickers in play,DD,"Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.  (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.)

Recession? CORE inflation? Debt ceiling? Who knows… but this market is still stuck in a massive 1.5 month long range from 406.4 to 416. At this point until a WEEKLY candle breaks and closes below 406.4 or over 416 I find it very unwise to trade anything long term… there is also a 5 week long closing range of 411.6 to 416 on SPY weekly too… that’s an incredibly tight $5 range that we have closed within for the last 5 weeks (assuming we close within it this week).

Tomorrow we will get a CORE PPI, PPI and unemployment claims release… the interesting thing about the PPI prints is that this will be a possible bigger rebound on PPI/ CORE… last prints actually were one of the best ive seen with a negative print… so a rebound into the positives could be poorly received. 

I once again find myself thinking “what is going to cause this market to sell off?” but not only sell off… but continuously sell off… and with CPI coming in soft I truly outside of another bank collapsing do not see a reason to expect a sustainable sell off… however, I also based on this 5 week long and really 7 week long range on the weekly with extremely low volume also don’t see the support for further upside… We officially have found ourselves in the pain zone…

The one common theme that I continue to see here on these SPY sell off days that then lead to massive intraday V bottoms is that TECH never truly sells off with the market… in my opinion until we see tech show true weakness and truly lead the sell off… these dips will continue to be bought up.

Also did anyone catch this news… 24/5 trading on some stocks and ETFs for HOOD? How exactly do they plan to do this?

Well I had mentioned I was surprised yesterday that we didn’t turn that doji candle into a supply… however, we ended up turning in a new supply today… however, this becomes problematic… why? Well simple… closing a daily candle over a supply that we just established is fairly imbalanced. So most probable that we need to do is eventually come back down to take out this 411.15 or at minimum close under it to attempt to establish a new demand (support) before we push back up. 

This imbalance here shows just how rangy and choppy this market has been. We still have strong support at 404.3 to 405 and strong resistance at 415.56 to 417… generally when a new supply is put in we favor a move to demand which would be 405.06… however, this imbalance actually would favor a move to 415.56 supply first.

When I take a look at the daily here I honestly want to see a bigger bull flag forming here… but I also obviously see a notable rising wedge that we have been in since February/ march. 

Todays hanging man candle is a tricky one as it actually is a bullish engulfing candle too. One could infer today was a retest of daily 8/20ema support and with the bounce and closure back over it that we would push higher… but as hopeful as I was that today would FINALLY give some answers to a direction for EOW and EOM… I am once again left with more questions than answers… I personally don’t see a reason as I mentioned at the beginning to go long until we break the weekly range we have been in for almost 2 months. Until that happens we remain in some painful ranges… 

I actually wouldn’t be that surprised to see a pretty sizable drop in volume again tomorrow and more tight range trading of the $2-3 range.

Here is where I love following ES along with SPY as they especially with supply and demand show a different story… 

Now yesterday we made that 4152 supply… today we immediately turned around and established a new 4135 demand (support) and closed over 4152 supply (resistance)… to me this opens up an opportunity to go long back to 4190-4198 supplies. 

I based on futures… which I find to be far more clear and helpful in this choppy tight reversal happy daily ranges… would be bullish and look for upside until a new supply is once again established.

Now taking a look at futures daily price action today actually turned into a 2 day bullish engulfing candle… granted this is a very long bodied DOJI… I actually see the huge daily 2 month long daily bull flag on futures but I also see a 5 day long bull flag on futures too… this would open the possibility to run back to that 4191-4199 area tomorrow or at least EOW. 

However, with data being dropped tomorrow morning we do not know exactly what to expect. I actually was fairly tempted to swing some calls over night but I know that for me I’m a better day trader than swing trader.

Well taking a look a here at the vix1d daily chart you can see that we attempted to breakout over the daily 8ema again and rejected. It also is notable that we are in a red bear channel and have nice slow blue support line… 

One could infer that until this down channel on vix1d is broken that we are stuck in more of this chop/ neutrally bullish price action. 

Now on the VIX you can see we did break trough the support of the red bull channel and have no formed a new white/ blue falling wedge inside of the major blue falling wedge. 

The current trend on the VIX is clearly down and realistically until that changes there is very little reason to expect sustained and long term downside on Spy… one thing that is notable though is that the VIX and SPY are correlating fairly well again. If and when the VIX closes under 16.96 support we have a nice little sell off shaping up down to that 15.72 support area which very well could propel SPY up to the 418-420 range.

One key thing I am seeing here is that especially DXY is currently showing is a massive downward resistance line that it has been trading within since the March 8th peak… one thing that I also believe will show the next leg down and sustain that leg down is a true DXY breakout which means the dollar regaining strength… it has absolutely gotten beaten up the last 2 months now. If and when that strength returns it should take TECH down with its strength… you can see much of the same trend here on 10YR which shows we are still in a massive downward move on 10yr… 

If and when these two in tandem breakout and the VIX breaks out… we might finally see a leg down… until then I still favor this neutral to bullish range trading.

Well today was a terrible start to the trading day… actually this is one of my worse starts to a week in probably a month or two… however, I was able to fight back after a terrible 1 for 7 win rate this morning… and managed to secure 12 wins in a row before I finally took an L during power hour. 

I went from being down about ½ of me weekly goal to no closing today up officially 50% of my weekly goal. 

Today was a attestment to a few things… 1. I should TRULY stop trading opening hour again… at least for a little while… the chop and reversals and volatility just are not allowing me to prosper anymore… and 2. No matter how far you are down and how chopped up you get IF you have a sound strategy and you stick to your strategies and rules.. in the end you will prosper. 

Don’t let a few days of bad trading or even a few hours of bad trading tilt you and make you break your own rules… Also you gotta realize that sometimes your strategy just wont work on certain days… my strategy follows momentum and continuation patterns which do not prosper well in low volume and tight range days.

## Trading Thesis - The Tastiest Crayons for Your Money 🖍️😋

Forget boring technical analysis—we're here to predict *today's* most important prices using the *flavors* of crayons from the past! 🤪

This tasty thesis is based on some delish option open interest that calculates *portfolio-level greeks* like Delta and Gamma. 🎭🎉 Once we establish these scrumptious numbers, we'll find out the juiciest price levels where gamma is just *so good,* and delta is dancing near 0. 💃💸

Some tickers have a flavor-defying price reaction to 👑 delta neutral, 💥 gamma max, or even—get this—*both.* It's this past price magic that makes our trading signals sizzle! 🪄🌟

The plays and target entry prices are cooked up with some *chef's kiss* binomial options pricing reflecting the size and duration of the delectable drama at 🍖 gamma max and 🍬 delta neutral affair. Catch this: the best plays get our taste buds tingling with a directional move, PLUS an IV boost! 🚀 IV drip or IV delicious? 😂

## Notes - A Little Spice in Your Life 🌶️💡

* If you missed out on biting into the entry price, be cautious! 🚨😬 Something changed from crayon-a-licious times to market open.
* Take a bite—sell half your position on a double, and then feast or freeroll the rest at your whim! 🍽️💫
* I'm a flavor risk taker, putting up to 1% of my taste capital on trades. 💪🍫 Low conviction? Just go for 0.5% to 0.25% and savor your dollar cost averaging. 😋💰
* Trades were whipped up pre-market open, so remember yesterday's garnishes might not be fresh today. 📆 🍰 New price movements could make that thesis taste a little off. 🤐

221,Market Recap - 5/10/23 - the grind continues,Discussion,"**The Fed**

US Apr Consumer Prices Increased 4.9% From Year Earlier; Core CPI Up 5.5%, largely as expected, but supercore CPI was lower than expected, and shelter essentially topped out, which pave the way to a steady decline going forward.  Yields tumbled, and stocks rallied in response. 

https://preview.redd.it/72trikoai2za1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d418262859532372a6e3a8ced3022ab0be9d2a05

The biggest contributor to CPI is still shelter costs, which have officially topped out: Shelter 8.11% down from 8.18% YoY; Rent 8.80% down from 8.81% YoY

https://preview.redd.it/943v0n1mi2za1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=53ff96b63e253e273795cf27b8ddbc1fd1143ab4

The used car price posted the biggest MoM increase in all CPI components. This is expected to continue in May (retail prices are still climbing) but likely cool in June (whole sale prices declined in April).

https://preview.redd.it/ti99sfifj2za1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0c1b5ed418698f499f0022a4fca3fe77f267f633

Looking at supercore inflation (core ex rent and shelter), which is the Fed's favorite inflation parameter, comes in unexpectedly cool: just 0.1% MoM, 5.1% yoy. 

https://preview.redd.it/lm1udleoi2za1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fca76b0385359be480f3df295eb355e29015f8e6

Supercore benefited from a steep drop in airline fares (-2.6% MoM) but this number can be volatile as we get closer to summer.

As a result, the June Fed hike probability went down to literally 0.

https://preview.redd.it/r1i7hm3sk2za1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7d889bc6ce3bd45cc5149a1098e9ebba5f90aba1

That being said, the market is projecting at least 1 rate cut this year which might still be too optimistic. US interest-rate strategists at Goldman Sachs are advising customers that the Federal Reserve will be less aggressive in cutting interest rates this year than markets are predicting, per Bloomberg.

More encouraging news around the globe in the war against inflation: Germany's inflation rate comes in at 7.2% below estimates of 7.3%. Mexico's headline inflation is also at its lowest level since Q4 2021. Global tightening may soon come to an end (except at the ECB, where some officials are starting to think a Sep rate hike may be needed).

I am still closely watching China's liquidity injection. China has requested banks to reduce the interest rate caps on certain retail and corporate deposits, starting on May 15, in light of recent softness in the domestic economy and exports. While this measure does not constitute a direct liquidity expansion, it could potentially be implemented if the situation continues to deteriorate.

Important Reminder: While evaluating the debt ceiling drama and considering both sides, it is crucial to acknowledge the following fact: While the Fed aims to combat inflation, the expenditure of the US government is escalating, experiencing a year-over-year increase of 13%.

**The Economy**

Consumer spending softened in April, per BoA data. Total card spending per household dropped to -1.2% compared with April 2022, the first negative YoY reading since Feb 2021. 

""The aggregate labor market picture remains solid, but Bank of America data suggests some deterioration at the higher end of the income distribution. Unemployment is rising fastest amongst higher-income households, while their pay growth is weakest.""

The good news is that the savings cushion is still at high levels. BoA said household savings and checking balances remain more than 40% higher than the average in 2019 across all income groups. The grind will continue.

Retail traffic confirmed consumers' soft demand for discretionary spending, and it is deteriorating.

The National Truckload Index (NTI) also confirmed weak goods demand. This index is now lower than the lowest point in 2019 and is quickly approaching the pandemic low.

**The Business**

While consumers' cash cushion is still thick, corporate cash positions are quickly diminishing. S&P 500 cash balances have dropped by 13% in the last 12 months; The slowdown in cash spending has started with buybacks.

As I mentioned in the weekend post, we are currently at the peak of the Fed's hiking cycle. This makes small growth companies particularly intriguing, as they tend to thrive in a low-growth, low-interest-rate environment. I will start to look into this sector and gradually add to my positions.

Another intriguing area to consider is real estate. The high interest rates have posed significant obstacles to the growth of this sector. However, given that we are now approaching the peak of interest rates, real estate, particularly residential properties where substantial demand has been suppressed, can emerge as another promising area worth exploring.

236,Debt Ceiling Scenarios from the White House,Discussion,"Despite some movement in the debt ceiling talks, significant progress remains elusive. Reportedly, President Biden has offered the Republicans potential compromises, which include the possible use of unspent coronavirus relief funds in order to cut back on government spending.

Following a meeting in the Oval Office yesterday, President Biden and Kevin McCarthy agreed to have their aides participate in daily discussions to identify potential areas of agreement. This decision comes in response to the looming threat of a default, which could occur as early as June 1.

As previously outlined, with the deadline for raising the U.S. debt ceiling drawing ever nearer, financial markets are likely to grow increasingly nervous. An actual breach, of course, could cause substantial damage to both the U.S. economy and the rest of the world.

[Should the U.S. government default](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2023/05/03/debt-ceiling-scenarios/) on its obligations to creditors, contractors, and citizens, millions of people might face job loss. With the government unable to enact counter-cyclical measures, there would be limited options to alleviate the impact on households and businesses.

**Anything Else?**

The cost of borrowing for the government, and consequently for taxpayers, would significantly increase. The ability of firms to finance themselves and to make productive investments would also be adversely affected. Furthermore, there would likely be a surge in volatility in equity and corporate bond markets.

**Fitch Ratings** has stated that, in the event of an actual default, “the US's rating would be downgraded to 'RD' (Restricted Default), and affected Treasury securities would be assigned a 'D'."" As a kind of early warning, last Friday, Scope Ratings placed the US AA long-term issuer rating under review for a potential downgrade. Additionally:

• **Moody's** cautions that even a brief debt limit breach could result in a decline in real GDP, nearly 2 million job losses, and an increase in the unemployment rate to almost 5%.

• A **Brookings** analysis suggests that losing the safety and liquidity of the Treasury market due to default could lead to over $750 billion in higher federal borrowing costs over the next decade.

• And **Peterson Institute** economists argue that lower demand for Treasuries could weaken the dollar's role in the global economy.

A protracted default\* would result in a severe recession, akin to the Great Recession. During the first full quarter of the simulated debt ceiling breach in Q3 of 2023, the stock market would plummet by 45%, severely impacting retirement accounts.

Moreover, consumer and business confidence would be significantly affected, leading to a reduction in consumption and investment. Consequently, unemployment would rise by 5 percentage points as consumers reduce their spending, and businesses lay off workers.

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **May 1st - May 5th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. **Both indirect and direct** transactions are included in the reports.
3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **April 24th - April 28th.**
4. **No companies without a ticker**
5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by algos behind Form Fore

On February 21, 2018, **the Company and its Leaders represented to shareholders on a conference call that it had “made impressive progress towards transforming our company in almost every dimension**, with every function and unit contributing in some way.” The Company and its Leaders repeated those representations in press releases and conference calls throughout 2018. These representations led to a two-day **stock price increase of 14.3%.**

On November 7, 2018, the Company and its Leaders acknowledged that Conduent (CNDT) had suffered reduced Q3 and projected Q4 operating results caused by “continued suboptimal performance from an inherited legacy technology vendor"" and that an **“outdated and historically under-invested legacy IT infrastructure has caused major disruptions to our operations and impacted clients and delivery performance.”**

These true facts caused **Conduent's (CNDT) common stock down 29.1%.**

Now Conduent will pay $32 million (5% of their market cap) in compensation to the former shareholders, to avoid further litigation on misleading statements.

244,Morning Briefing 🌞 May 10th 2023,Discussion,"Mornin' - [Last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13coaa1/morning_briefing_may_9th_2023/) - Markets have been volatile this week as investors await the latest inflation data and the outcome of the debt ceiling negotiations.

Inflation: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for April came in at 4.9%, which was slightly below expectations. This suggests that inflation is still rising, but at a slower pace than it was in previous months. The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates in an effort to combat inflation, but it is unclear how effective these measures will be.

Debt ceiling: The United States government is currently facing a debt ceiling, which is a limit on the amount of money it can borrow. If the debt ceiling is not raised, the government will be unable to pay its bills and could default on its debt. This would have a devastating impact on the economy and could lead to a recession.

**Watchlist**

**DIS** - Disney is scheduled to report its quarterly earnings on Wednesday. Analysts are expecting the company to report earnings of 93 cents per share on revenue of $21.79 billion. Investors will be looking for any signs of weakness in Disney's business, as well as for updates on the company's restructuring plans.

**ON** - ON Semi is coming down to its 50 daily MA which could cause a move higher over the coming weeks from this outperforming stock.

**NKE** - Nike is coming down to test support around $124 which should cause this stock to move higher off this level especially given Nike trades above all major daily MAs.

**QCOM** - Qualcomm is coming down to test support around $106.70 which is where shares had bottomed back in late 2022 and November.

**TSLA** - Potential bullish TTO setup on the 4hr time frame. A break above 169.16 can send us to 171.55 to fill the gap above, followed by 172.50~, then 173.80 completing the TTO.",2023-05-10 13:18:25,20,TLDR? wat buy?

##SPY

Markets moved with our predictions over the last couple days as we didn’t see much movement or volume with the much awaited CPI print that just was just released. **CPI came in at 4.9% which is less than the 5% median estimate.**

SPY bears opened a second bear gap yesterday which will act as resistance for bulls - so as it stands we have bear resistances at **~413 and ~415**. 

**SPY** is gapping over **413** premarket and maintaining will see a run to **415**. If we break above **415.5** the floodgates are open to **418 and 420**.

Failing **under 410** will see a move toward **408** and possible lower move for the island bottom bulls opened last week.

**CPI**

So everyone wants to know… CPI what will it be and where is it going next? And most importantly how will the market react… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qy8ssj6y8vya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=866aedc7efbc142cdf03e4db30c171dbaedf67ca

Based on my analysis here these are the probable numbers we shall see tomorrow… but of course here is my actual prediction… 

CPI YoY- 5.1%  
 CPI MoM- 0.5%  
 CORE YoY- 5.5%  
 CORE MoM- 0.4%

So now the biggest question would be… how is the market going to react? 

Well currently the market in my opinion expects CPI (inflation) to continue to unwind… they expect that inflation is under control and will continue to unwind straight to that magical 2% area… well in doing so they have put themselves in a TERRIBLE position… why? Well the markets have priced themselves into a corner where they see a pause in June… no hike/ cut in July… then 3 cuts at the meetings after to get to a 425-450 fed funds rate by end of year…

Whats the issue with this? Well its simple… IF CPI rebounds or shows any signs of plateauing… whats the reaction going to be? Well they are going to have to price in a 25bps rate HIKE at the June meeting… and that is going to mess up all of this markets plan for 75bps of cuts by EOY. 

If CPI comes in hot on YoY and Mom tomorrow in my opinion we are looking at a true 2-3% melt down and not only that but we are going to continue to sell off the rest of the week… the only thing that could stop that is a cool PPI print the next morning. 

If markets has to reprice their fed funds rate by EOY this could be the catalyst markets have truly been waiting for. 

Now if I am wrong and we get a CPI of 4.9% or lower… well lets just say we are probably going to see a rocket ship to 440 within a very short period of time…

SPY daily did not establish a new supply at 412.99 as I was expecting it too… though tomorrow if it is red we should establish a new one there… 

I see that we closed directly in the middle of this range… that means our upside target is really 415.56 to 417.03 and our downside target is 404.3 to 405.06.

Absolutely BRUTAL price action today with no continuation and lots and lots of tight ranges… we spent an hour an 6 cent range at one point… 

We have a major downside support at 405.2 then 399 and we have a major upside resistance at 416.8 then 419.5. 

Possible CPI Targets

Bulls- 416.84 (1.45%+) -> 419.5 (2.08%+)

Bears- 405.2 (-1.4%) -> 401.4 (-2.33%) -> 399 (-2.93%)

For me I don’t think that the upside case is there for me as VIX is so low and really CPI is already EXPECTED to come in lower and lower… a surprise upside beat especially that 5.1% im looking for with MoM rising would absolutely start a huge leg down though… for me im bearish.

Now interestingly enough futures DID turn 4152 into a new supply (resistance) which means that our target should be 4073 minimum but I still am eyeing that 4040/4055 supplies that we have come ever so close to so many times… 

If we get an upside beat tomorrow then we would look for 4190-4198.

Futures impressively only put in a 22 point range today… that’s a very small movement for nearly 24 hours of trading… 

CPI potential targets

Bulls- 4198 (1.51%+) -> 4237 (2.4%)  
 Bears- 4073 (-1.53%) -> 4055 (-2.01%) -> 4040 (-2.34%)

**VIX**

Started tracking the VIX on TOS and idk why just sometimes it just looks nicer then TV… maybe it’s the dark mode… jk light mode for life! 

Anyways the VIX continues to hold just under that daily 20ema. You can see we are really in a diamond pattern here which means if we can break through 20.42 (+15.4%) tomorrow then we might actually be looking at a bigger upside push to 22.6 to 24.18… if that happens then we are looking at a fairly big dump on SPY which would correlate with a CPI miss…

However, if we break support tomorrow of 17.32 then we are going to look to target 15.72 support once again.

Fun fact… this is the LOWEST the VIX has closed pre-CPI in over a year of CPI releases… 

Once again the risk is to the downside not the upside… actually something else that is incredibly impressive to me is the fact that the IV on 1dte contracts for tomorrow closed under 20%... that’s incredibly low… I remember a time when SPX ATM contracts were like $4000/ play… you had to go almost 20 strikes OTM just to get a lotto sized play… IV used to easily hit 80-100% on CPI days… IF we get a big miss and surprises tomorrow puts might see some fireworks. 

I did not open up longer term (60dte) puts today… I wanted to but with the cheap 1dte I decided to swing a 1dte put instead… my thoughts here is that if we miss I will win big… if we beat with IV this lower and only being a handful of strikes OTM with the probability of another flat open I should be able to get out relatively unscathed… I would then look for the 418-420 range to start a long term bearish play.

Today was another hard trading day with this tight ranges and lack of continuation… I made a few good trades and made some bad trades… the biggest issue was even with 1dte I found that when I was correct the underlying just didn’t move enough to pay us for our efforts. Ended up barely covering commissions today and still have a little red hole to recover from this week.

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
* **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-12.
* **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""
* **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

This is another milestone for WSB and its regarded members. WSB made it to Arte TV. Since most of you regards are from the US of A, you probably never heard of Arte TV. Well, as weird as it sounds, Arte TV is a  joint venture between France and ... Germany (yes, weird, I know). The point is that Arte TV is THE legit and highly regarded TV channel in French and Germany, best known for its (usually) well-made documentaries. Two weeks ago, they released a documentary about WSB and its regarded  members. I believe it's only available in french and german, and since most of you are from the land of the cheeseburger, you probably won't understand shit (nor have access to it so use your VPN of choice).

# Trading Below Net Assets

Rivian has fallen 90% since its IPO at the end of 2021.

Rivian’s market cap is now only $13b. It has $12b of cash on hand and $14b in shareholder equity (assets minus liabilities). Its existing factory will be able to produce 150k vehicles/year when fully operational, at $75k/vehicle that will generate $11b in revenue. Its second factory is already in the works to build the next generation (R2), which will be cheaper.

For comparison, Tesla is trading 11x shareholder equity and 6.4x revenue. Tesla is a better company but not a better stock.

# Rivian Actually Makes Great Cars

Marques Brownlee reviews (big tech review guy) [owns one and likes it](https://youtu.be/wR-0knMVSGw). Even its detractors say its handling is unmatched in the EV space. The SUV pickup space is the hottest sector in the US car market.

Demand for EVs is massive and will grow exponentially over the next decade. Making vehicles that look great, handle great and have some nifty features is more than enough to sell everything you can make. Rivian has years of orders with little to no marketing.

There's not too much competition, Cybertruck looks weird and isn't available yet, Ford F150 Lightning is being made in very small amounts.

They’ve also gone after the delivery van space with an exclusive deal to supply Amazon. Electric vans make more sense than semi-trucks, as road weight limits reduce carrying capacity due to the weight of battery packs.

&#x200B;

# RJ Scaringe Doesn’t Have To Be A Rocket Scientist

The CEO of Rivian, RJ Scaringe, isn’t a grandstanding visionary. He’s slightly awkward, introverted and thoughtful with a genuine passion for crafting great cars. While Rivian won't be offering robotaxi trips to mars anytime soon, I'd argue they don't need to do more than make great cars for a rapidly growing market.

When an industry needs to be created or revolutionized you need visionaries who can take 0 to 1. Electric cars are coming out of that phase and into one of iterative improvement. We will increasingly need leadership with high attention to small details, who will perfect what already exists.

Rivian isn't burdened with a sky-high valuation requiring earth-shattering innovations to maintain.

&#x200B;

# Emeralds Can Crack

Being politically active on Twitter and divorced is a bad combination. What Elon craves most of all is attention and then validation. The constant dick-sucking from fringe crazies and mocking from normal people is going to drive him further out there. He doesn’t have close friends, is cut off from his family and can’t hold down a relationship. There isn’t a counterbalance in his life to stop him from getting nuttier.

This is going to bleed into the Tesla brand, particularly if he fully loses it.

&#x200B;

# EV Is Supply Constrained

Last year 750k/16m vehicles sold in the US were electric. Over the next decade EVs will reach almost 100% market share for new vehicles. The last few covid/slowdown years have been awful for car sales but EV has kept powering on despite this.

Meeting this demand is the hardest part. Heavily indebted, low multiple, traditional car companies have invested hundreds of billions into factories that are becoming obsolete. EVs are a radically different business from combustion. The Ford f150 lighting is a great car, but they shipped just 3,600 in the first couple of months of 2023. This is what creates the opening for new players that have a head start.

&#x200B;

# The Bad

Rivian is burning cash rapidly, it burnt $7b in the last year and is forecast to burn $4b this year. At this rate, it will need to raise more cash within 24 months. At the current low valuation, this would be very dilutive. They have a path to profitability but to afford rapid growth they’d need the share price to significantly recover.

The founder/CEO Scaringe looks to have sold most of his shares in the company which isn’t a sign of confidence.

Rivian doesn’t benefit from most of the massive Tesla charging network, building their own is expensive. Rivian isn’t as far along with self-driving AI.

Amazon has an exclusivity contract for the delivery vans, but they've ordered far less than originally promised. Rivian is looking to end the exclusivity agreement.

**Rivian has gotten killed along with the tech stocks it trades with. However, unlike tech stocks, Rivian has invested billions in hard assets, not intangible software. You can buy it so cheap that unless the business generates 0 ROI on its assets/cash, you're guaranteed to make a return.**

**Rivian makes great cars, that look incredible, in the hottest sector of the car market (SUV/pickups), in the exponentially growing EV space. They're benefitting from so many tailwinds, yet the stock is priced below net assets. Even with the challenge of raising fresh funds, their burn rate is decreasing, much of the heavy investment is already done and they have years of runway.**

**It's very difficult to see how this could go much lower, and it is very easy to see how it could go much higher. I foresee it being many multiples of its current value within a year or two.**

265,Guys! ABNB Earnings are Today! How are we gonna get a 5-bagger?,DD,"It's finally time. Airbnb (ABNB) is scheduled to report their earning results today after hours. As you guys know, the company connects hosts and guests online and allows them to book travel services and accommodation facilities worldwide. For the first quarter, Airbnb expects revenues between $1.75 billion and $1.82 billion, implying year-over-year growth in the band of 16-21% on a reported basis and 18-23% on an FX neutral basis. This is most likely driven by growth in European travel and a gradual recovery in China.

To keep things simple, I'm going to put the entire post in jot note form and then provide my conclusion at the end.

**What to Consider**

* Airbnb has been witnessing steady improvements in long-distance and cross-border travel due to relaxed travel restrictions. This is likely to have continued to aid its performance in the first quarter.

* Growing momentum among travelers is likely to have continued driving the [Nights and Experiences Booked](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1193532/airbnb-nights-experiences-booked-worldwide) and Average Daily Rates in the to-be-reported quarter.

* Strengthening demand in North America, EMEA and Latin America is likely to have driven ABNB’s performance in the quarter under discussion.

* Increasing guest demand for non-urban nights is expected to have continued driving active listings for non-urban destinations in the quarter under review.

* Airbnb’s consistent efforts to enhance various aspects of its services to gain momentum among its hosts and guests are likely to have benefited the quarterly performance.

* Analyst [Sachin Mittal](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/sachin-mittal) maintained a Buy rating on ABNB stock with a price target of $153

* [Cost cutting measures](https://www.tipranks.com/news/airbnb-nasdaqabnb-trims-headcount-slightly-despite-hiring-plans) taken earlier will reflect higher margins in this quarter.

* However, uncertainties related to the coronavirus pandemic are expected to have been concerning in the first quarter.

* The impacts of macroeconomic headwinds, including rising prices and geo-political tensions, are likely to get reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.

* Intense competition in the online travel market is anticipated to have been an overhang in the to-be-reported quarter.

**Concluding Thoughts**

In the end, we have a booming travel industry that's ripping back and above pre-pandemic levels. Airbnb's are *still* cheaper than hotels. The number of users are growing and the platform has been consistently rolling out new features. I'm gonna literally jump in on calls. Last earnings, we saw the stock rise up +14%. Can it do this again? Doubtful. But what the hell, time for a call spread. I'm buying the 5/12 135c for $241 and selling the 140c for $132. This means the spread can be bought for only 109 bucks, and can offer 4.6x gains *if* the stock goes up 9.6%. Historically, the average move (either up or down) has been about this much. But bare in mind, as with all my other posts, these are entirely meant to just educate people about what we tend to look for when making an earning prediction. It by no means can be considered financial or investment advice.

271,Fed’s John Williams says rates could be increased if inflation doesn’t come down,Discussion," 

* New York Fed President John Williams cautioned that “it will take time for the FOMC’s actions to restore balance to the economy and return inflation to our 2% target.”
* The current problems in the banking industry and their impact will factor into Williams’ policy outlook, he said.
* “We haven’t said we’re done raising rates,” he told the Economic Club of New York.

New York Federal Reserve President John Williams on Tuesday cautioned that interest rate increases will take a while to work their way through the economy before inflation returns to an acceptable level.

The central bank official gave no forecast for where he sees policy headed but said he doesn’t expect inflation to return to the Fed’s 2% goal until the next two years. Should inflation not come down, he said the Fed always has the option to raise rates.

He added that unemployment is likely to rise to a 4%-4.5% range, from its current 54-year low of 3.4%.“Because of the lag between policy actions and their effects, it will take time for the \[Federal Open Market Committee’s\] actions to restore balance to the economy and return inflation to our 2% target,” Williams said in prepared remarks at the Economic Club of New York.

“First of all, we haven’t said we’re done raising rates,” Williams told CNBC’s Sara Eisen during a Q&A session after his speech. “We’re going to make sure we’re going to achieve our goals and we’re going to assess what’s happening in our economy and make the decision based on that data.”

273,Virgin Galactic (NYSE: SPCE) Post Earnings Call - Super Bullish for 2023!,DD,"SPCE’s Q1 2023 earnings call last night was the most promising I’ve heard so far.

**The news that was “new” here was on the Delta class space tourism business.**  
For the first time the company released details about the economics of this business and the numbers were frankly pretty amazing… and the market gives SPCE no credit for Delta…as of today …

$50m - $60m cost to build each Delta Class ship  
$2.7m+ revenue per flight, $400k variable operating cost per flight  
6 month payback  
75% contribution margin per flight including the amortized cost of each incremental mothership and Delta class ship

**These are contribution margins that many businesses can only dream of… and the execution risk is low as they have a working SpaceShip (VSS Unity), which is fundamentally the same design as Delta, about to go into commercial service!**

Of course there is some capex to be spent upfront re. development costs but with $874m cash in the bank as of 31 March 2023 they are well funded to cover these costs for the next 12-24 months. And **with economics like this the Company will have absolutely no problem finding a joint venture partner to share risk and provide non-dilutive funding** if they choose to go down this route.

Also pleasing was the Company’s efforts to reduce cash burn, as they have deferred development of the next generation mothership and will be using the current mothership, Eve, for flight testing the Delta class ships. **As a result the expect cash burn for 2023 is lower than previously forecast.**

**With the first commercial space flight scheduled for end June, and rumours of a “BIG CELEBRITY” flight planned for end July followed by the re-opening of ticket sales, it looks like this space tourism business is about to take off in a big way!**

**Perhaps my earlier forecast of a $15 to $100 stock price was not so off the mark given the Delta economics above…**

*A side note - there are currently some small hedge funds with short positions using the post/pre-market to push the stock price down post earnings. They were wrong footed by SPCE’s early announcement of powered space fights so they are feeling the pain and are very bitter, hence their attempts overnight. I wouldn't worry about these guys. Like I said small hedge funds with very limited firepower so in the grand scheme of things nothing to worry about. The market will wash them out as the stock price increases over the coming weeks with the powered space flights. A few guys here are being paid by these hedge funds to down ramp the stock - just ignore them* ***AND BUY THE DIP!***",2023-05-10 07:28:49,10,"This thing is dead and will not wake up.

278,Do Lower Interest Rates Equal Dumber Investments?,Discussion,"The connection may seem totally random, why would the interest rates the Fed borrows and lends at make investments dumb? However, there seems to be a series of incentive structures that correlates the two.

The Federal Funds Rate dictates all market returns. Long story short on the math, bonds are priced at the current Federal interest rate plus extra for the default risk, and equity funding is priced so the average return is akin to a bond plus a bit extra for all the risk. Even dividend-paying REITs, where the price of the stock moves until the dividend yield offered matches the Federal Funds Rate plus an appropriate risk premium. This is all fair and efficient.

A bank's business model is to take deposits, give loans, charge fees for originating the loans, collect interest for said loans, and use the spread between the low rate they borrow at and the high-ish rate they lend at to pay their workers. While not as heavily regulated as a commercial bank; investment funds, investment banks, private equity firms, and so forth have this same business model where they take money from one guy and invest it in another and make money off the returns and fees.

For obvious reasons, the amount of lending is inversely proportional to the Federal Funds Rate. Higher interest rates equal fewer people willing to borrow, while if interest rates are zero there is simply no reason in the world you should not borrow all you can. This is why in the past year with rising interest rates the number of new mortgages this year is a third of that of last year. Startups are being hit harder because the amount of funds offered to founders for a 50% stake of the business is a fraction what it was when the money printer was still running.

However, the profit margins of a bank and bank-like business are directly proportional to the Federal Funds Rate. Obviously, loans with better yields equal more profits, while near-zero interest rates equal razor-thin profit margins upon their loans whilst the number of loans goes up. Manhours cost money, due diligence takes manhours, ergo the incentive with falling interest rates is to do less due diligence. This appears to be true, as back in 2021 one major private equity firm averaged a deal a day. Likewise, with the FTX fraud, no one seemed bothered that SBF didn't offer board seats to investors, almost as if the investors weren't planning on using them anyway.

We all recall 2021 when it seemed that everything seemed to go up in stocks, including several major frauds and many firms that had no chance of succeeding. However, those prices may have all been fair at the time since growth stocks are valued at their expected future value, minus the return on Federal bonds, minus the risk of the venture. Since the Federal Funds Rate was near zero, all that was required for absurd valuations is the expected future profits to go up, or the investment is considered safe.

It is not necessary to ever become profitable, just keep announcing new ventures and SOMEONE will give more funding to keep the firm afloat. If that sounds like a Ponzi scheme, it is because it is. And since all Ponzi schemes eventually run out of money, when the expected returns are lower the scheme can go on for longer. There is even the potential for legal Ponzi schemes in the form of innovative startups. The founders may know for a fact there is almost no chance of getting anything marketable, but they also know they can do the science they love for a living for years until the firm runs out of money.

Why would anyone fund these regardless what interest rates are? Consider the story of the Barrett .50 cal. A reporter in Vietnam saw the heavy machine guns the marines were using and thought ""I gotta get me one of those."" And so, with no engineering, business, or machining background whatsoever, this guy and some hired help managed to put together a bolt action rifle that used the monster-sized .50 caliber ammo. They were disappointed that there was little interest in the rifle in the civilian world on account the ammo costs 3-6 dollars a round, but several armies placed a bulk order and started calling it an ""anti-material rifle."" What that means was they loaded it with explosive rounds and used it as a one-man cannon to chew up vehicles and stuff.

I bring this up because sometimes batty business ideas actually do take off and become wildly successful. So ask yourself, if you met this guy when you were starting out, how much cash would you have given him in exchange for half of all profits that came from the patents of the guns? When interest rates go down, the amount of cash that guy would receive from such a deal will go up.

I forget which investment bank it was that gave funding to funding to both Uber and Lyft, who immediately spent that money competing with each other. Zero-sum games seem to have been more common with lower interest rates, with a furry of people playing an expensive game of hot potato with monkey art and digital tokens. People bought into certain stocks because of the possibility of a short squeeze, again a zero-sum game. As interest rates go down, silly games like those become less unreasonable, and as we all see once interest rates go up you simply stop hearing from these guys.

So you see the incentive at a bank when interest rates are zero. Simply load up on risk and fund everyone just so you inevitably grab a winner. Don't bother doing any fact-checking because you can't afford to pay anyone to do that and it doesn't matter anyway. The incentive for the entrepreneur is likewise to get equity funding even if you don't know what you'll do with it. Everyone will feel rich for a time while everything is going up in paper value, but when things start crashing down everyone's returns will normalize to mediocre levels. Voila! Lower interest rates have created dumb investments.",2023-05-10 06:58:00,8,Yup

**The Fed**

Consumers are looking to pull back on spending, which is a good sign for disinflation.

MORGAN STANLEY: Our consumer survey respondents “are looking to pull back on discretionary goods spending: Categories with the most strongly negative net spending intentions continue to be consumer electronics, leisure activities, home appliances, and food away from home ..”

Employment has been very resilient so far, but UBS expects a negative print in Q3 - ""The deceleration in employment is clearly under way, but at a slower pace than expected last month. .. the point at which total private payrolls turn negative appears less imminent. \[Our\] team continues to expect that point to come in the third quarter of this year.”

**The Economy**

The April NFIB small business report was released today. The optimism index has hit a new low, primarily driven by soft measures such as expectations rather than hard measures like current conditions. In comparison to last month, the biggest decline was seen in sales and earnings growth expectations, indicating a challenging period ahead. However, there is positive news regarding employment, which remains strong, and credit conditions have stabilized (possibly also influenced by low loan demand and expansion plans). Additionally, selling prices have consistently declined, which is a positive indicator for disinflation.

Liquidity update: In the short term, liquidity is showing a decline, but on an annualized basis, it has rebounded from its lowest point, although it still remains negative year over year. I am particularly concerned that liquidity could rapidly diminish if the value of collaterals, such as residential properties in the 2008 crisis or T-bills and offices at present, depreciate. It is likely that the depreciation of T-bills is mostly behind us as we approach a pause by the Federal Reserve, but the collaterals of other assets may not have reached their lowest point yet.

China imports growth unexpectedly falls to -7.9% in April (prev. -1.4%, est. 0%). Exports growth also slowed from 14.8% to 8.5%. Despite the reopening trade, recent data i.e. PMI cease to surprise on the upside indicating a soft domestic and global demand.

S&P Global Market Intelligence cut forecast for U.S. real GDP growth in 2023 to 1.2%, down from 1.4%. Additionally, the forecast for 2024 has been reduced to 0.9% from 1.5%. These downward revisions indicate a more cautious outlook for the U.S, and bulls should be cautious as downward earnings revisions might follow.

The same trend was also confirmed by the Bloomberg consensus GDP forecast, which showed an improvement for Q2 compared to the beginning of the year. However, it indicates a downward trend for Q3 and Q4.

The Business

The Guidance Index indicates that companies have shifted towards a more positive stance during this reporting season. However, it's worth noting that the trend of the index has been declining since 2021.

https://preview.redd.it/852fyq6ywvya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=993629aee64d6b8603f3fbb1d517f88075640738

Corporate buybacks have indeed been strong throughout the year, providing support to stock prices. However, the question is: how long can it last?

https://preview.redd.it/kmogd9qywvya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3107daf72e74b7291a3b81473e31283915dcfd18

One important chart to review is the interest coverage ratio of US corporations. The interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing a company's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by its interest expense during a given period. Thus, a higher ratio is generally preferable. Currently, the interest coverage ratio is still hovering at its highest level in the last two decades, indicating that even with the high Fed rate, companies do not currently have a significant debt problem. This situation could change if earnings begin to decline and companies start to refinance their debts at higher rates in the current environment.

Another sign of consumer spending slowing down came from ABNB's earnings report. Airbnb said it expects bookings growth and average daily rates to decline in the current quarter, signaling a reverse in demand trends.

283,Volume tickers in play,DD,"Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

Things to consider when finding the plays-

·       If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day. 

·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.  (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.) 

·       The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move. Some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed.",2023-05-10 12:07:05,4,">The float is the number of shares available for trading. It is calculated by subtracting restricted stock from a company's outstanding shares. The float can give you an idea of how volatile a stock might be and whether there is enough liquidity to enter or exit a position. To find out if a ticker has high volume, look at the average daily volume over the past 50 days and compare it to the current day's volume. If it is significantly higher, that means there are more buyers than usual, which could lead to price appreciation."
284,How I Turned Market Volatility into a $375k Windfall: My VIX Trading Strategy Revealed! (With More Data and Enhanced Strategy!,Discussion,"I'm back with an even more detailed look at my VIX trading strategy that led me to $375,000 in profits. Thanks to your insightful comments, I've further refined my strategy and uncovered additional patterns from my dataset, which spans 16 years of market data. Let's dive deeper into the analysis and explore the enhanced strategy!

**The Data**

As a reminder, I analyzed 16 years of VIX, SPX, and market indicators data from 2005 to 2021. The dataset included:

* Daily VIX and SPX closing prices
* Gamma highs and lows
* 50, 100, and 200-day moving averages
* Moon phases (full moon and new moon dates)

**Key Insights and Revisions**

With your comments in mind, I revisited the dataset and discovered even more fascinating patterns that further strengthened my strategy:

1. From 2005 to 2021, on average, the VIX increased by 3.57% during new moons and decreased by 2.81% during full moons. This trend persisted across various market conditions and reinforced my decision to use moon phases in my trading strategy. As u/5JeepHardRock pointed out, full moons occur approximately every 29.5 days, which helped me better time my trades.
2. The inverse relationship between the VIX and SPX was particularly strong during significant market events. For instance, during the 2008 financial crisis, the VIX reached an all-time high of 80.86, while the SPX plummeted by more than 50%. This insight was crucial in helping me identify opportunities to short the SPX and buy VIX call options.
3. In the 16-year dataset, there were 27 instances where the Gamma spread was above 85. In 22 of these instances (81.48%), the VIX experienced a decline within the next 3 to 5 trading days, providing a perfect setup for my Thunder Call spreads.
4. Bullish markets saw an average VIX decline of 4.92% when the 50-day moving average crossed below the 200-day moving average. This pattern helped me time my Thunder Put trades to capitalize on potential market reversals.
5. As u/Winter-Efficiency598 mentioned, I didn't make any significant gains in 2021. This is because the VIX was essentially flat during that year. However, I consider it a win, as my strategy helped me avoid unnecessary trades and potential losses in a volatile market.

**The Enhanced Strategy**

With the newfound insights and revisions, I've refined my initial strategy as follows:

1. During new moons, I shorted the SPX and bought VIX call options.
2. During full moons, I engaged in long puts on the VIX (Lightning Puts).
3. If a full moon occurred and the Gamma spread was 85 or higher, I entered a Thunder Call spread.
4. In bullish markets, I timed my Thunder Put trades to coincide with the 50-day moving average crossing below the 200-day moving average.
5. In periods of low VIX movement, such as 2021, I exercised patience and avoided unnecessary trades.

**Further Opportunities**

u/Comicdn and u/Affectionate_Fix8401 suggested that I could also explore potential squeeze/pump plays alongside my complex options trading. This is an excellent idea that could potentially boost my profits even further. I plan to delve into this area and share my findings with you all soon.

**Final Thoughts**  


 The more data you have, the better equipped you are to make informed trading decisions. By analyzing 16 years of VIX, SPX, and market indicators data, I was able to create a robust strategy that led me to a $375,000 profit. Your comments and feedback have been invaluable in refining and enhancing my approach.

Remember, investing is a journey of constant learning and adaptation. Be open to new ideas and strategies, and always strive to improve your understanding of the markets. Thank you all for your insights, and I look forward to continuing this conversation and learning from each other.

Good luck, and happy trading!

P.S. As for the Jugo ETF idea from u/Winter-Efficiency598, who knows? Maybe one day, we can all collaborate to launch it together.  

Edit to the original post:

Update: Some people have mentioned that they think I'm joking because of the funny names I've used for my strategies. Let me clarify my approach.

To keep things straight, I come up with memorable names for my findings and then use data science to validate my hypotheses. If a hypothesis fails, I set it aside in case I can use a portion of it within another strategy or as a precursor. I like to think of strategies as switches in a house. You need to have multiple switches, but if they're all on, you're being wasteful. If you only have one on, you can't see clearly. The goal is to have a few on for the room you're in, setting the right vibe.

In other words, each strategy is not always engaged. They all have their own on/off switches and dimmers, as well as a master kill switch and a full-house surge protector. This approach allows me to adapt and optimize my trading strategies based on current market conditions.

288,"China, Taiwan, Semiconductors, and Intel",Discussion,"Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor; I barely know how to read.

Russia updated the existing playbook re: how to invade a neighboring country without getting the US involved. At this point, it doesn't seem to be ""whether"" China will invade Taiwan, it's more like ""when"". And apparently Taiwan and semiconductors have some sort of relationship.

So I asked ChatGPT, ""Who has technology, know-how, resources, etc. to actually try to cover a potential loss of semiconductors or increase in prices?""

*Semiconductor manufacturing is a highly specialized and capital-intensive industry, and it cannot be quickly or easily ramped up in response to sudden geopolitical changes. The technology, knowledge, and infrastructure required to build advanced semiconductor manufacturing facilities (also known as fabs) can take years, if not decades, to develop and billions of dollars in investment.*

*If China were to invade Taiwan, potentially disrupting the operations of major Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturers like TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), it would have a significant impact on the global semiconductor supply chain, including the U.S. market. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the following entities might potentially step in to mitigate such a disruption:*

1. *Intel Corporation (USA): Intel has been investing heavily in its manufacturing capabilities and announced in 2021 that it plans to become a major provider of foundry services in the U.S. and Europe. However, as of 2021, Intel's foundry capabilities are not yet on par with TSMC's in terms of the most advanced processes.*
2. *Samsung Electronics (South Korea): Samsung has extensive semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and could potentially increase its production to cover some of the demand, but this would require significant investment and time.*
3. *Other global semiconductor manufacturers: Other companies, such as Micron Technology, Texas Instruments, or Infineon, could potentially increase their production or expand into new areas, but they would face similar challenges as Intel and Samsung.*
4. *US Government initiatives: The U.S. government has been taking steps to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers. This includes proposed funding and incentives for semiconductor research, design, and manufacturing through legislation like the CHIPS for America Act.*
5. *Global cooperation: Other countries and regions, including Europe and Japan, are also interested in expanding their semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. Global cooperation could help mitigate the impact of a potential disruption in Taiwan.*

*However, it's important to note that any mitigation efforts would face significant challenges and would likely take several years to have a substantial impact. The most advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes, such as those used by TSMC to produce 5nm and 3nm chips, are incredibly complex and difficult to replicate. Additionally, expanding semiconductor manufacturing capabilities would require significant investment, a highly skilled workforce, and an extensive supplier network. As such, it's unlikely that any entity could fully cover a significant disruption in Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing in the short term.*

Then I looked at Intel's stock, sitting at like \~$30, less than half of what it was two years ago with basically the same balance sheet, and started wondering, am I missing something here? How can the market be so fickle with this company that actually \*makes\* physical/real stuff? Is Intel not a decent-looking buy/hold given their $20b investment in a New Albany manufacturing facility and other non-Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing locations (e.g. Ireland)?  Would it be an easy buy ""if"" China invades Taiwan? Even if not, isn't every day China doesn't invade Taiwan an extra day Intel gets to play catch up? Is the time-horizon on this too long to be interesting? Is Apple going to step in and prevent this war?",2023-05-09 22:06:42,17,"I hate to tell you this, but ChatGPT's knowledge stops circa 2021."

295,Probably the dumbest Earning Play to date: Let's tackle RIVN,DD,"This is probably going to be my most degen post to date. Just read every other word to save braincells. By god, Rivian (RIVN) is going to be announcing Q1 earnings results on today, May 9th, after market close. The consensus EPS Estimate is -$1.58 (+61.5% year-over-year) and the consensus Revenue Estimate is $661.97M (+596.8% year-over-year) vs. a pathetic $95M a year ago.

**Earnings history**

In 4Q22, the company saw [mixed results](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rivian-rivn-q4-earnings-report-2022-2cd0e80e), with a negative gross margin forecast for 2023. In 2024, the company anticipates a positive gross profit. Last month, [the company reported](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ev-maker-rivian-beats-quarterly-delivery-estimates) deliveries of 7,946 vehicles in Q1 to top the consensus estimate of 7,752 and production of 9,395 vehicles at its Normal, Illinois plant during the quarter vs. 8,752 consensus.

The company said it is on track to produce 50K vehicles in 2023 with production starting to ramp up. Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 4 upward revisions and 3 downward. Revenue estimates have seen 0 upward revisions and *8 downward.*

**Analysts ratings**

[Piper Sandler](https://www.pipersandler.com/) analyst [Alexander Potter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-potter-1ab391137/) downgraded Rivian Automotive to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $15, down from $63 citing funding concerns. Mr. Potter explained that the company's current strategy requires lots of funding that may discourage investors in the current macro environment. He estimates that RIVN will need to raise over $4B to fund long-term growth beyond 2025.

RBC Capital analyst [Tom Narayan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-narayan-4567b812/?originalSubdomain=uk) downgraded the company from Outperform to Sector Perform, with a $14 price target, down from $28. While the firm believes Rivian is ""well positioned to capture market share as the industry shifts towards electrification,"" it sees few catalysts to increase profitability in the short term and believes the company's margins will ""remain constrained.""

Morgan Stanley lowered the price target to $24 from $26 and maintains an Overweight rating. Rivian investor confidence has been poor following a 2022 ""plagued by ramp delays, macro headwinds, and an ensuing EV price war."" They said that after adjusting its model, the firm's ""bull case"" objective drops to $45 from $55 and its base case target drops to $24.

**What to do for Earnings?**

Wow these are a lot of bearish sentiment, so puts for earnings? Consider the price targets tho and Rivian's current price of $14. So am I getting calls? Oh man. Decisions. The key question is whether Rivian’s 2023 production guidance of 50,000 units is achievable.  Consider the economic uncertainty, expenses, and a struggling EV industry. Even Tesla is down massively from it's recent highs of 180s. At this year’s low, RIVN stock was down 36% for 2023. However, the recent gains have cut those losses to “just” 26.4%. Welp, time to go balls to the walls. Full send, on 5/12 13p @ 0.59. Can make this a put spread to spend even less money, buying the 12p cuts the price in half, can get the spread for only 29 bucks. This means potentially 3.4x profit if RIVN crashes 14% with earnings. But bare in mind, as with all my other posts, these are entirely meant to just educate people about what we tend to look for when making an earning prediction. It by no means can be considered financial or investment advice.",2023-05-09 18:08:29,25,"Intels “worst” earnings ever is worse.

We'll have a lot to consider today, including speeches from Federal Reserve officials, earnings reports from several major companies, and developments on the debt ceiling. Two important inflation data points will be released later in the week, with the consumer price index due out on Wednesday and the producer price index on Thursday. Several notable companies will report earnings today, including Fox Corp., Nikola, Airbnb, Rivian, Virgin Galactic, and Rocket Lab. Investors will be looking for updates on these companies' businesses and outlooks. The battle over the debt ceiling resumes on today as lawmakers in Washington try to avoid a first-ever sovereign debt default by the United States. Biden is scheduled to meet with the top four lawmakers in Congress to discuss the issue. The Treasury Department has warned that the U.S. could run out of money to pay its bills as soon as June 1. Aramco, Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil giant, reported a 19% decline in first-quarter earnings from a year ago. The decline was due to lower oil prices, which have fallen as the global economy reacts to high inflation and the potential for a slowdown. However, Aramco's profit still beat expectations, coming in at $31.9 billion. The company is planning to expand capacity and its CEO said that the company's ""long-term outlook remains unchanged.""

**Watchlist**

**MARA** - This crypto correlated stock has bottomed around $9.30 over the past couple weeks. Now that we are coming down to test support around this level I believe we could see a move higher.

**RIOT** - Riot is coming down to test support around $10.50 which is where shares have bottomed over the past ten days.

**USOIL** - This oil stock is coming down to support around $70. Buying calls on Usoil seems advantageous due to the effect of the lifting of the debt ceiling. The US has been buying oil around $70 to fill up the strategic reserves, but now since the government is still negotiating a deal on the debt ceiling to fund the government the US can't buy oil. But once this agreement is met the US will surely come in and buy some oil which will be a bullish catalyst for oil and gas.

**AMD** - I'll be looking at calls above the 94.25 trigger and target 96.11, 97.24, and 98.30 based on its ATR. If we do get a pullback tomorrow we may bounce around the 91.48 level.

**Earnings**

**ABNB** - For the first quarter, Airbnb expects revenues between $1.75 billion and $1.82 billion, implying year-over-year growth in the band of 16-21% on a reported basis and 18-23% on an FX neutral basis. Airbnb has been witnessing steady improvements in long-distance and cross-border travel due to relaxed travel restrictions. This is likely to have continued to aid its performance in the first quarter.

**RIVN** - For the first quarter, the consensus estimate for RIVN’s loss per share has widened by a cent in the past seven days. Its bottom-line estimates imply a decline of 5.59% from the year-ago reported numbers.

298,Confused about the debt ceiling? Here’s what you need to know,News,"The White House and Republicans in Congress are mired in a standoff over the debt limit. Failure to raise or suspend it could result in the first-ever U.S. default. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that the U.S. could run out of money to pay its obligations as soon as June 1 if Congress doesn’t address the matter.

With neither side looking likely to budge, here’s what you need to know about the situation.

# What is the debt ceiling?

It is the maximum amount of money Congress allows the federal government to borrow to cover its bills. Because the government typically spends more money than it collects in taxes, it must take out debt to pay its expenses. Unlike a credit card, though, the expenses were already approved by Congress, so the debt ceiling does not pertain to new spending.

The mechanism was created during World War I in an effort to simplify borrowing. Prior to 1917, Congress needed to approve additional debt for each new spending measure it passed. Until recently, it has been a rather routine process. Congress has lifted the debt limit 78 times since 1960. The debt ceiling was last raised in December 2021 by $2.5 trillion, capping the limit at $31.381 trillion.

If Congress does not agree to lift the debt ceiling, the government will not have money to pay its bills and will default on its debt. The Treasury Department has already begun to take extraordinary measures to continue to fund the government, but Yellen said she expects funding to entirely deplete in early June.

# What happens if the U.S. defaults?

Defaulting on sovereign debt would wreak havoc on the economy and roil markets around the world. A default on Treasury bonds could throw the U.S. economy into a tailspin. The last time Congressional Republicans threatened a default in 2011, Standard & Poor’s downgraded the U.S. credit rating for the first time ever to AA+ from AAA.

If the U.S. were to default, gross domestic product would drop 4% and more than 7 million workers would lose their jobs, Moody’s Analytics recently projected. Even a brief default would lead to the loss of 2 million jobs, according to the data.

In that scenario, U.S. bond ratings would be classified as “restricted default,” according to Fitch Ratings, and Treasurys would have a D rating until the U.S. could once again borrow. The Brookings Institution noted a default could lead to $750 billion in higher federal borrowing costs over the next decade.

What’s more, a default would shake the U.S. position on the world stage. U.S. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told the Senate Intelligence Committee last week that Russia and China will take advantage of the U.S. potentially defaulting on its debt. Haines warned the two nations would attempt to highlight “the chaos within the United States, that we’re not capable of functioning as a democracy.”

# What about government programs?

Were the U.S. to default, it would mean a pause on tens of billions of dollars in payments. The Bipartisan Policy Center estimates in the first half of June, $50 billion in Social Security benefits are set to be dispersed, $20 billion in Medicaid provider payments, $12 billion in veterans’ benefits, $6 billion in federal salaries and $1 billion in SNAP benefits.

In an interview Monday with CNBC, Yellen demurred when asked how payments would be prioritized.

“There are no good options; every option is a bad option,” Yellen said. “I really don’t want to get into discussing them and ranking them because as every Treasury secretary has known, the only option that really leaves our economy and our financial system in good shape is raising the debt ceiling and making clear that Congress stands behind the basic principle that America pays its bills.”

# What is the Republican position?

Republicans are concerned about the increasing national debt, which has grown from less than $1 trillion in the 1980s to more than $3 trillion today. They are refusing to lift the debt ceiling unless it is paired with spending cuts.

House Republicans passed the Limit, Save and Grow Act last month outlining the areas they want to pare back. The bill would impose sweeping cuts to federal discretionary spending, impose new work requirements for welfare recipients and expand mining and fossil fuels production, all in exchange for raising the debt limit for about a year.

# What is the White House’s position?

The White House has remained steadfast that it is Congress’s responsibility to raise the debt ceiling without conditions, as was done three times under the Trump administration. President Joe Biden has repeatedly called on House Republicans to pass a clean debt ceiling increase and have a separate conversation about spending cuts in the budget.

The president has pleaded with lawmakers to engage in “normal arguments” instead of ultimatums.

“As I’ve said all along, we can debate where to cut, how much to spend, how to finally overhaul the tax system to where everybody has to pay their fair share or continue the route their on, but not under the threat of default,” Biden said Friday. “Let’s remove the threat of default. Let’s have normal arguments. That’s why we have a budget process to debate in the open so you all can see it.”

# What’s next?

Leaders from both parties will have to continue discussions in order to reach a compromise before the projected June 1 deadline. If they do not, the Treasury will have to begin making decisions on which bills to prioritize before they run out of money entirely, something Yellen has called untenable.

302,$PYPL possibility of a ‘bank run’ on Venmo & PayPal?,DD,"I recently realized that I'd allowed a $3,751 balance build-up in my Venmo account, mostly from reimbursements from friends for shared dinners out. Knowing that PayPal and its Venmo accounts are not FDIC insured, I began to wonder how PayPal invests the money in those accounts and what might happen if all their customers withdraw everything from their accounts. I was also wondering if the loans PayPal has made and if the money in accounts is invested in a way that would be subject to interest rate risk. 

From what I could gather, a run on PayPal and Venmo accounts would result in a significant outflow of funds from these platforms, which could harm PayPal's revenue and, consequently, its stock price. However, the extent would depend on various factors, including the outflow size, the run duration, and the company's ability to manage the situation.

Also, PayPal's revenue comes from various sources, including merchant fees, transaction fees, and interest income from its lending and credit products. And I could not seem to find much on how significant a part these balances play among all their revenue streams.

According to PayPal's website, funds held in PayPal and Venmo accounts may be eligible for the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) protections, which include error resolution and limitations on liability for unauthorized transactions. However, these protections are different from FDIC insurance and may not cover all losses.

According to PayPal's financial reports, the company invests its cash and cash equivalents in a diversified portfolio of high-quality short-term and long-term fixed-income instruments, including US and non-US government and corporate securities, money market funds, and time deposits. Depending on the duration of these instruments, PayPal's investment portfolio could be subject to interest rate risk. PayPal states that it seeks to maintain liquidity, safety, and yield in its investment portfolio.

For example, if PayPal holds a significant portion of long-term fixed-income securities in its investment portfolio, it could be exposed to declining market value if interest rates rise. On the other hand, if PayPal invests in short-term fixed-income securities, it may be less exposed to interest rate risk but may earn a lower yield.

PayPal's TOS states it may use these funds for various purposes, including funding its operations, acquisitions, share repurchases, and investing in strategic growth opportunities.

PayPal may also use the funds held in its PayPal and Venmo user accounts to provide credit and lending services to customers, such as PayPal Credit and Working Capital. In such cases, PayPal may use the funds to issue loans or provide credit to customers and earn interest income on these loans - I'm not sure if the rates on these loans are variable or fixed, and if so, for how long.

But, it seems PayPal could be subjected to interest rate risk based on how it invested the cash held in its PayPal and Venmo user accounts and the structure of the loans it made. Interest rate risk refers to the potential impact of changes in interest rates on the value of an investment portfolio. When interest rates rise, the value of fixed-income securities such as bonds typically falls, and vice versa.

The amount of cash users hold in their PayPal and Venmo accounts is likely to fluctuate constantly, and it may not be easy to estimate the exact figure accurately.

Long story short, I moved my $3,751 balance to my checking account, and I feel better now. If any of you have any thoughts, I'd appreciate hearing them.",2023-05-09 14:31:12,32,"Interesting, I was looking at maybe taking long position on PayPal because the stock is just so beaten down still. But now not so sure 😂"
303,Trulieve TCNNF: a deep value Tier 1 US MSOS that dominates Florida and is rapidly growing in other States that'll benefit from SAFE Banking,DD," 

Here is some dd I've compiled from various sources on Trulieve which I believe to be severely undervalued and an easy double with SAFE Bank projected to pass this year

* Trulieve Cannabis has the most retail locations of any MSO, branching outside of FL (2 stores opened in Georgia recently with more than 180 stores in the US).
* Trulieve's third quarter GAAP gross margin at 54% per Q4 is among the highest in the industry
* Trulieve is trading at less than 1x revenue guidance for its fiscal 2022.
* SAFE Banking hearing this thursday May 11th to facilitate banking services for MSOS
* Strong balance sheet (1.2x Next Debt / 2023 EBITDA without income tax and lease liabilities) with 219M$ in cash

# Introduction

https://preview.redd.it/0moprhl7wuya1.png?width=716&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4a59a054a642a34a1dd8ea484701013eb9aa1203

The Senate scheduled its first hearing for cannabis banking reform, thanks to efforts by Senators Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon) and Steve Daines (R-Montana).

One reason the act is important to U.S. cannabis companies is because they currently have to operate on an all-cash basis. This has become a security issue as dispensaries have been targeted for robberies. The act would also give cannabis companies more options for funding.

Trulieve is the largest cannabis company in the U.S. by number of retail outlets, with 181 dispensaries across 11 states. Last week, it opened its first two medical marijuana dispensaries in Georgia with plans to open three more in the state this year.

The company leads in Florida with 125 medical-use dispensaries and would be in a great position to benefit if the effort to legalize recreational-use cannabis sales in that state succeeds. Trulieve has been one of the biggest financial supporters of the ballot initiative, spending $30.5 million on the Safe & Smart Florida petition, which needs a little more than 50,000 additional signatures this fall to reach the 2024 ballot.

# Fundamentals

Trulieve exited the 4th quarter with $219 million in cash, largely due to $165 million in new notes and loans. The notes and loans, at rates of 7.5-8.0 percent, give Trulieve a good risk/reward profile in the sector. Regarding cash flow, Q4 operating cash flow was $55 million and free cash flow was $21 million.

Last year 2022, Trulieve set a company record with revenue of slightly more than $1.2 billion, up 32%. It also had a net loss of $246 million for the year, compared to net income of $18 million in 2021.

However, when you exclude non-recurring charges and other moves connected with streamlining their operations and the Harvest Health and Recreation acquisition, the adjusted net loss last year was only $30 million. That means that as the costs associated with the buyout of Harvest Health ebb, the company's profitability should improve. The company has had 20 consecutive profitable quarters of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). (source: Jim Halley)

# Valuation

Looking at the 2023 projections, Trulieve is expected to have the second-highest revenue among its peers and the largest adjusted EBITDA. The same can be said for 2024. The table below shows the valuations for 2023 and for 2024 on an enterprise value to projected adjusted EBITDA basis:

&#x200B;

[source: Alan Brochstein](https://preview.redd.it/xfbtbgq4wuya1.png?width=726&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=54b41d40d8b21113b90c487d34e8afe3306b9e39)

3.4X projected adjusted EBITDA in 2024 is the lowest among the five companies, though its projected margin is the highest. Its margin could come down as it expands outside of Florida and as Florida potentially declines for everyone. If one reduces the margin by 20% to 27.0%, the EV/adjusted EBITDA for 2024 would still be 4.3X, which is below Curaleaf, the highest at 6.7X, and GTI, at 5.1X.

EBIDA is often used for MSO valuation - esp. when put in context vs. the broader market - given the disproportionate tax burden from 280E. Trulieve isn't as highly leveraged as other MSOS with 1.2x Net Debt/ 2023 EBITDA and is in an enviable position to profit the most from a switch to a recreational market in Florida and access to 280E tax write-offs.

# Conclusion

Trulieve is by far a leader in Florida as an MSOS, and it also leads in Pennsylvania with 19 medical-use dispensaries. The state's governor, Joe Shapiro, included potential adult-use sales tax in his budget. Pennsylvania borders four states that have recently legalized adult-use sales -- Delaware, New Jersey, New York, and Maryland

If you want to invest in cannabis, the US is where you want to be and among the MSOS, Trulieve forms one of the higher-quality plays.

well taking a look at SPY here we have a few options... 

Scenario 1 (the bull scenario) is a breakout over 416.4 by end of June. This would give us an upside target of 427.42 by september with an extreme upside target of 436.9.

Scenario 2 (the consolidation scenario) is we hold in this 395.95 to 416.12 diamond until July. from there we would have a consolidation area of 389.9 to 416.12 through november. 

Scenario 3 (the bear scenario) is that we finally breakdown out of 406.82 by end of Juen which opens up an opportunity for 381.77 to 395.95 by September. Extreme bear case would be 374.47. 

Overall personally i lean towards a 374.47 by September.

On futures...

bull case- breakout over 4191 and push to 4285-4387 by end of August. This gives extreme upside target of 4538.

consolidation case- 3897 to 4191 range held till end of septmeber.

bear case- breakdown under 4051. from there we push to 3746 to 3897... with an extreme downside push to 3587.",2023-05-09 17:24:25,15,Thanks daddy

312,Exploring Tightening Credit Conditions: Key Takeaways from the Recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey,Chart,"In March, more banks tightened credit terms for medium and large business loans (46%) as compared with January (44.8%). Lending standards for residential real estate loans also tightened in all categories except for government-sponsored enterprise-eligible and government residential mortgages, while demand for all residential real estate loan categories weakened.

Banks cited a less favorable or uncertain economic outlook, reduced risk tolerance, collateral value deterioration, along with concerns about funding costs and liquidity positions as reasons for the tighter credit conditions being applied to commercial and industrial loans for large, middle-market, and small businesses, as well as for all types of commercial real estate loans.

Overall, the situation is not as bad as many expected, considering regional banking stress, but it's not encouraging either. Two reasons for concern include the possibility that the full impact of First Republic Bank's collapse **may not have been reflected in the loan reporting to date**, and that **decreased loan demand from small and medium-sized businesses might further slow down the economy**. Last but not least, banks reported their expectation that loan standards would soon **tighten across all categories**.

The economy is slowing down and there is more uncertainty about the future. This makes lending less attractive for banks and they are requiring businesses to have more collateral to get loans approved. Small and medium-sized businesses are especially vulnerable because they often don't have the same access to capital as large businesses. This could further slow down the economy if these businesses can't get the financing they need to grow or invest in new projects.

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
* **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-12.
* **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""
* **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

319,Why cash is king for now,Discussion,"ANYTHING THAT CAN’T GO ON FOREVER WILL END. - Herb Stein

TL;DR – We are facing an economic collapse on multiple fronts. Safe-haven assets such as cash and precious metals will shine as the best option moving into the coming economic storm. A lot of people will learn the hard way that stocks DON’T always go up.

We are facing several economic headwinds such as the debt ceiling debacle, a transition to “green” alternatives, threats of de-dollarization, the world of crypto and its role in the future, sky high house prices and the beginnings of a banking crisis as consumers buckle under high interest rates. So how does one navigate all these issues? Where should you put your money? Not in stocks… yet. As the pendulum swings left to right and right to left so the marker moves in cycles. History always repeats itself just in different forms following different timelines. This is because human nature does not change.

**Bubbles**

The aggregate US market value right now is roughly $43.89T versus the annualized GDP is roughly 26.58T. The US market value is an absolutely staggering figure at 165% higher than annualized GDP. This model is often referred to as the Buffett indicator. The value of the market is over one half larger than the economy. This is considerably higher than the market has ever stood (sustainably) in modern history—higher, even, than the peak of the Great Bubble of 1929. The stock market is forward looking yes but the economy will have to increase by over 60% for stocks to be valued fairly or the value of the market would have to fall by 40% before this indicator shows a FAIRLY priced market. How likely is this increase in the near(ish) future? I put odds at 0%.

The recent market rally looks great for many, however the classic dead cat bounce serves as a word of caution to those who know what next chapter of this story holds.

It reminds me a little of that story of the oil prospector who died and went to heaven. And St. Peter said, ‘Well, I checked you out, and you meet all of the qualifications. But there’s one problem.’ He said, ‘We have some tough zoning laws up here, and we keep all of the oil prospectors over in that pen. And as you can see, it is absolutely chock-full. There is no room for you.“ And the prospector said, ‘Do you mind if I just say four words?’ “St. Peter said, ‘No harm in that. “So the prospector cupped his hands and yells out, ‘Oil discovered in hell! “And of course, the lock comes off the cage and all of the oil prospectors start heading right straight down. “St. Peter said, ‘That’s a pretty slick trick. So,’ he says, ‘go on in, make yourself at home. All the room in the world. “The prospector paused for a minute, then said, ‘No, I think I’ll go along with the rest of the boys. There might be some truth to that rumor after all. “Well, that’s the way people feel with stocks. It’s very easy to believe that there’s some truth to that rumor after all.”

**The tech bubble.** Valuations for tech companies soared as investors piled into “the next big thing” As of mid-2001, Since the market’s peak in March 2000 over four trillion dollars of stock-market value had evaporated. At least 112,000 dotcom employees had been fired. Amazon was trading at $17 down from its all time high of $113. The tech bubble had popped and value investors were sorting through the wreckage looking for companies with value that could survive. Over the two decades since billions were made on the back of this collapse, but the collapse had to happen first.

**Auto Bubble** “In the early 1900s there were two-thousand auto companies in the United state. The most important invention, probably, of the first half of the twentieth century. It had an enormous impact on people’s lives. If you had seen at the time of the first cars how this country would develop in connection with autos, you would have said, ‘This is the place I must be.’ But of the two thousand companies, as of a few years ago, only three car companies survived. And, at one time or another, all three were selling for less than book value, which is the amount of money that had been put into the companies and left there. So autos had an enormous impact on America, but in the opposite direction on investors.” – Warren Buffet

While things like cryptocurrency, AI and Evs seems to be the hallmarks for future business investment I would approach with caution. Mass speculation over each industry has fueled sky high valuations of these sectors and, while one may argue crypto has already corrected, these industries are still being defined and a washout of the “weaker” players is still imminent.

**Crypto.** People love bitcoin and other coins because of their utilities but these assets have high price fluctuations and while some people love the risk, few have seen a realized reward. people keep piling money in because crypto is the future right? The fact of the matter is a lot of people are risk averse, they want something stable. As countries create their own digital currencies (Texas is advancing a Gold backed digital currency bill) these options are most likely to be adopted by the general public. I am sure a few apes, drug dealers and others will still use BTC or whatever other crypto rises from the ashes but its utility will most likely be limited to some degree. A digital greenback is likely.

**EVs**. While Tesla is most likely not going anywhere the EV race will see some losers. Legacy automakers are pilling millions upon millions into developing their own EV tech. The are only so many people buying cars and only so much market share to go around. When you buy companies that trade at astronomical P/Es you are expecting and investing in their future growth. Be aware of the pitfalls of greed and realistic in regards to what companies can actually achieve. The other issue faced by the idea of EVs is infrastructure. City grids have not been built to accommodate every house having an EV let alone two, the wires literally aren’t big enough for the ampacity draw. On the municipalities side bigger wires means bigger conduits meaning any underground wiring needs to be dug up and reinstalled. On the consumer side you are responsible for the wire from the property into your house. Some estimate the cost to redo the wiring to your house in order to accommodate an EV is roughly $7,500 and that is just for one EV, not two and it is a cost that you will have to pay. It should also be noted that property taxes will also increase as bigger power lines are installed to distribute power throughout ageing municipalities.

**A “Greener” Future where you have less green in your account.**

**Net Zero.** As countries strive towards reducing their carbon footprint government worldwide are looking for ways to innovate and revolutionize the way we use and consume energy and create pollution. Net zero homes are not a brand new concept but they are becoming built more frequently and along with countries setting standards on minimum ev production rates building standards requiring houses to be net zero are also getting a foothold. A typical net-zero home costs between 10%-30% more than an average, conventional build. Do you own a house? Are you able to afford a house? If you have to pay 10-30% more for your home could you have done it? Or would you have had to sacrifice size or other amenities because of your budget? This move towards net zero building standards is not optional and not a matter of if but a matter of when. This increase in will further fuel a crunch on the average Joe struggling to maintain their quality of life.

**Real Estate.** With rates hitting their highs average Joe is feel pressure but not pain, yet. Unemployment is relatively stable and people can still get jobs, however mass layoffs have been affecting companies and as the claws of the interest rate hikes dig in deeper the layoffs will be more pronounced and people will struggle to pay their mortgages along with high grocery prices. This is because true pain is a lagging indicator, people are struggling to stay afloat but it is manageable for now but how long this sustainable for until something breaks? Are you able to pay your mortgage or rent and groceries and still some money left over to save? Or yolo into something like BBBY?

Within the commercial real estate sector in the USA 1.5 Trillion in loans will be maturing over the next two years. Developers and landlords are calling for more time to restructure and repay debt. All while, the value of their buildings is deceasing. Consider that the bulk of commercial real estate loans were financed when base rates were near zero — far below today’s rates closer to 5%. Not only are the rates higher, but the real estate values are much lower, especially in cities afflicted with high vacancy rates from ongoing work-from-home policies. Prior to the pandemic, 95% of U.S. offices were occupied. Today, that number is closer to 47%. The drop wiped out $453 billion of commercial real-estate value, according to the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). More than 70% of municipal taxes come from property taxes. Without a healthy market, developers will be forced to seek tax-abatement, resulting in lower collections for city budgets, and less resources for public schools, law enforcement, public transportation and other municipal services. A sustained lack of activity in U.S. cities will further diminish the vibrancy of businesses that rely on foot traffic from offices and residents — ranging from restaurants, retail stores and more.

House prices are also expected to decline 15% in the back half of 2023. Imagine putting 5% down on a house that is now worth 15% less than what you paid.

**What to do.** “Now, Aesop was not much of a finance major, because he said something like, ‘A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.’ But he doesn’t say when.” Interest rates—the cost of borrowing—Buffett explained, are the price of “when.” They are to finance as gravity is to physics. As interest rates vary, the value of all financial assets—houses, stocks, bonds—changes, as if the price of birds had fluctuated. “And that’s why sometimes a bird in the hand is better than two birds in the bush and sometimes two in the bush are better than one in the hand. ”In his flat, breathy twang, the words coming so fast that they sometimes ran over one another, Buffett related Aesop to the great bull market of the 1990s, which he described as baloney. Profits had grown much less than in that previous period, but birds in the bush were expensive because interest rates were low. Fewer people wanted cash—the bird in the hand—at such low rates. So investors were paying unheard-of prices for those birds in the bush. Casually, Buffett referred to this as the “greed factor.” -The Snowball -Alice Shroeder/Warren Buffet.

The Fed has been aggressively hiking rates into an inverted yield curve, this is not good, in fact this is the most inverted yield curve since 1981. A recession is coming. The only question now is will the recession be mild or severe. A lot of that will depend on the duration and the extent in the contraction in credit that lies around the bend. The Fed implicitly is calling for a recession. A soft landing that follows the Fed tightening cycle has happened 20% of the time. But at those times the Fed was not tightening into an inverted yield curve. The futures market is pricing in two rate cuts in the second half of the year. I think the Fed will be cutting rates a lot more. Everything moves in cycles. We know that in recessions, whether severe or mild, the Fed historically cuts the funds rate by 500 basis points. They’re not going to signal that right now, with unemployment at 3.5% and inflation at 6%, but that is the historical record.

At a minimum, they’re going to have to take the funds rate down to 2.5%. They’re going to have to cut rates a lot, because the one thing that hasn’t changed in this cycle is the Fed’s own view of where the neutral fed funds rate is, and that is 2.5%. Getting to 2.5% is only eliminating the excess tightening that they’ve put into the system in the past year. A lot of people don’t realize the extent of the tightening in monetary policy. The current funds rate is double the Fed’s own estimate of neutral. Which is why the yield curve is inverted as it’s been, and the money supply is contracting at an unprecedented 2.5% annual rate.

Right now interest rates are high, as of now, any cash that would be eaten away by inflation already has been. Holding cash and collecting interest is a wise choice as we wait for value to be found in the market. As we move into a recession (however deep it may be) Gold and other precious metals are also a good choice.

**When**. While it is impossible to accurately time the market it is not impossible to predict what will occur. Market cycles are just that, they are cyclical cycles with a predictable pattern. While the depths of bear markets and the peaks of bulls markets cannot be accurately predicted ahead of time we can say with certainty that they will happen. The closest thing we can do to predicting when is looking into the past

fundamental bear market lows occur only after the Fed has cut interest rates significantly, re-steepened the yield curve, and with the bond market helping re-establish a more appropriate equity risk premium.

Based on historical data, the average time between the S&P 500 peak and the onset of recession is about 6 1/2 And it takes an average of 12 1/2 months for the S&P 500 to go from peak to trough, which usually happens before a recession ends. (See chart below.)

Average Recession Timeline

What I am watching for is the pause which I assume will happen next month. We should rally until then and I believe we will see renewed optimism after the pause announcement as everyone starts getting bullish again in hopes for rates to come down in the third and fourth quarter of this year. If history is right though we haven’t felt full economic pain and even in a pause max pain will not be felt its only once the fed realizes it needs to starting cutting rates that we truly feel the full effects of the rate hikes that have taken place. The recession itself, is a lagging indicator. By then It will be too late to sell but a great opportunity to start buying and DCAing in all the way to the floor.

321,Stock Market Corruption; PROVE ME WRONG; what are your thoughts on my perspective?,Discussion,"Upon reflecting on losses. Yes, we can always make better financial decisions but what I had not accounted for when investing was naked short selling and illegal market practices without regulation. If I had known that certain securities in the equity market could be illegally flooded with excess supply diluting and manipulating the price I would have never entered the market to begin with had I known what I know now. I knew this was a practice in the market however thought it would eventually be regulated, denial, self-deceit or fact? Will transparent markets ever be in place? It is disappointing to see how loosely regulated the securities market is. I almost wish I was in self-denial, did I make poor decisions? Yes. However, I could have never anticipated and or planned for more than 100% of a stock’s float to be in circulation; Who would think you can buy more tickets on an airplane than there are seats? I had many contingency plans; accounting for rampant fraud was not one of them. Had I known of the deception, would I ever have entered the market? My conclusion; the stock market is dirty; a precaution for all, if I could give one. 

People often say to me that I need to consult a Financial planner but they too assume the financial markets are regulated too, no different than I. Rules and regulations are in place, but blindly assuming they are being followed and enforced is a mistake. Who regulates the regulators? The only difference between the stock market and a casino is that casinos kick out the cheaters as I have heard stated. Credentials and having further investment knowledge does not change the fact that the rules and regulations aren’t being followed by exchanges and brokers. Nobody can make an informed decision if authoritative individuals have the ability to illegally dilute the price of security without repercussions. Counterfeiting money is penalized but individuals who counterfeit shares are not enforced as it should be, even though illegal. This is the issue. It’s not a tough market it’s a forged market. 

We as ""retail"" shareholders are treated with contempt, foolish, stupid, and inexperienced.

325,Volume tickers in play,DD,"Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers
Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment’s price. 
I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million. 
The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

·       If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play. If trading less than the movement of the ticker, I would consider a short or put play.  (If all the other factors previously mentioned checks out.) 

·       The trades are researched afternoon daily to find possible tickers making a big move. Some of the prices may be less depending on day and time trade is executed.",2023-05-09 12:02:24,9,">Thank you for your question. As far as finding the right plays, it really depends on a number of factors, including market conditions and the specific security involved.

327,"Is Harley Davidson going green, and are they now the most innovative Motorcycle Manufacturer?? A Business Strategy Overview",Discussion,"Harley-Davidson is an iconic motorcycle brand rooted in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, over a hundred years ago. Over that time, they've been through profound changes and are looking to accelerate innovation and investments in growing their brand to stay relevant within the motorcycle market.

To start, the primary focus of Harley-Davidson is to design, engineer, and advance the most desirable motorcycles in the world. This is reflected in their commitment to quality, innovation, and craftsmanship. They also want to focus on customers by delivering adventure and freedom for the soul. They aim to build a lifestyle brand valued by the emotion reflected in every product and experience for riders and non-riders alike. Currently, they're investing heavily in the most vital motorcycle product segments. Harley-Davidson plans to invest significant time and resources in strengthening and growing its leadership positions in the most profitable motorcycle product segments, specifically Grand America touring, large cruisers, and trikes.

They also want to win in attractive motorcycle segments in the fastest-growing markets. The company plans to selectively expand into and within motorcycle segments, explicitly focusing on product segments that are profitable or aligned with the company's product and brand capabilities, such as adventure touring and middleweight cruisers. They're also investing in leading in the electric motorcycle market. Electric motorcycles are essential to the company's future, and it is committed to and passionate about leading in this sector. Harley-Davidson creates products, services, and experiences that inspire its customers to discover adventure, find freedom for the soul, and live the Harley-Davidson lifestyle. The company's parts and accessories, apparel licensing, and financial services businesses all operate as essential pillars of the company's future success as a global lifestyle brand.

Regarding customer experience, they have several initiatives. One is called 'Hardwire,’ which puts customers at the forefront of the company's products, experiences, and investments. From the rider who may dream of motorcycles or is just learning to ride to the riders who are deeply passionate about and invested in the Harley-Davidson lifestyle, the company recognizes its customers' different needs and expectations. It is creating touchpoints tailored to individual needs. Around inclusive stakeholder management, prioritizing people, the planet, and profits, the company strives to deliver long-term value to all stakeholders, including employees, dealers, customers, suppliers, shareholders, and communities. Focusing on the planet and profits, some of the outcomes they're trying to achieve include inspiring interest in riding, fostering a motorcycle culture, and building a passionate community of Harley-Davidson riders.

They also aim to strengthen and grow their leadership positions, win in all attractive motorcycle segments and markets, and enhance their position as the most desirable motorcycle brand in the world. A few campaigns they're working on include building a global manufacturing footprint, which enables the company to be close to its customers, provide quality products at a competitive price, and grow its overall business. They also focus on technology development, with an approach to product and go-to-market actions that reflect the expectations of the targeted customers to deliver the most desirable electric motorcycles in the world. Touching back on the 'Hardwire' project, the company plans to grow the profitability of these businesses to refresh product and program offerings, stronger execution, and additional opportunities, including digital and in-dealership purchases.

Around customer experience, they are powered by integrated data, and the goal is to seamlessly engage with customers, creating a meaningful, unique, and personalized experience with Harley-Davidson every time. For inclusive stakeholder management, being the underlying and unifying theme, the company will drive additional shareholder value for its investors. As a producer of heavyweight gasoline-powered motorcycles, the company recognizes the impact its products and its products have on the environment. Harley-Davidson strives to reduce its environmental impact across all aspects of its business and is committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The company aims to set interim targets by the end of 2023 to reach net-zero carbon emissions. These targets are based on the principles of the Science-Based Targets initiative, aiming to keep the Earth's temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius. The benefits of high-quality carbon credits focus on nature and biodiversity conservation.

As it defines its path to achieving net-zero carbon emissions, the company is focusing on the following areas:

1. They are improving fuel economy and reducing emissions from combustion products.
2. Working with suppliers and through the upstream tiers to reduce the impact on the entire supply chain.
3. It uses less energy and increases the mix of renewable energy in its factories and offices.
4. They are advancing and leading the industry in electric motorcycles.
5. Lastly, it defines its approach to using carbon credits and offsets, focusing on supporting sustainable development and resiliency.

Regarding retail financial services, Harley-Davidson provides retail financing to customers, primarily installment lending for purchasing new and used Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Harley-Davidson Financial Services' retail financial services are available through most company dealerships in the U.S. and Canada.

Concerning training and development, the company has launched new employee experiences that involved approximately 290 employees learning about the company and connecting with others, including leaders. The company also launched the Manager Development Program to help new managers understand their roles and responsibilities as new leaders and a continuous development program for existing leaders and additional hires.

The company opened its first company-owned retail dealership in the U.S., exclusively selling LiveWire electric motorcycles through in-store and e-commerce channels. The company's parts, accessories, and apparel are all sold through the company's e-commerce website in the U.S. and specific European markets. Products on the U.S. e-commerce website are retailed to customers through authorized U.S. dealers. The company also sponsors motorcycle rallies, leasing activities, music festivals, and other special events. It distributes its motorcycles through an independent distributor in India. This independent distributor sells the company's products through independent Harley-Davidson dealerships.

The company plans to focus on approximately 50 global markets that matter most to its future growth. This includes the following priority markets: the United States, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Japan, China, Canada, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, and New Zealand. The company will also continue to test further avenues for desirable long-term growth, such as premium low-displacement motorcycles. The company issued a Global Workplace Ecosystem policy, reflecting the shift to a more flexible work environment where employees fit within the establishment, on-campus, hybrid, remote, or field roles. Most of the company's salaried workforce is categorized as hybrids.

Lastly, the company continues to establish and reinforce long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with its suppliers regarding raw materials and purchased components. Through these collaborative relationships, the company gains access to technical and commercial resources for applications directly related to product design, development, and manufacturing initiatives. In addition, through a continued focus on collaboration and strong supplier relationships, the company believes it will be positioned to achieve its strategic objectives and deliver cost and quality improvements over the long term.

As you can see, Harley-Davidson is making significant investments to grow its brand across various worldwide markets and strive to become a front-runner within the technology segment, specifically electric motorcycles. This is a substantial shift from its traditional approach of cultivating a brand centered on old-school values and traditions.",2023-05-10 14:07:20,0,10 minutes video with this summary: [https://youtu.be/lvbkQhwk3ZE](https://youtu.be/lvbkQhwk3ZE)

342,Welcome to the chop zone… 5-8-23 SPY/ ES Futures and VIX Daily Market Analysis,DD,"Well I had assumed after Fridays huge push up that we would see continuation today followed by a doji/ consolidation day tomorrow. However, the consolidation and extreme chop came today. Today managed to only put in a full $1.96 of range on SPY or about 40% of the 10day average range… Futures only put in a 23.5 points of total movement on futures which is 43% of the 10 day average… to say today was a tight range is an understatement. 

We also closed today at 47mil volume (that will probably rise to about 55-60mil by 8pm but this would make it one of the lowest volume days of the year…. The current lowest of 2023 is April 19th which was a 55mil volume day. 

The market despite what it tried to lead on last week clearly is a little on edge for CPI on Wednesday. 

**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

We currently find ourselves trading just over the middle of this 405 to 415 channel. We are slowly creeping our way up to that 415.56 and 417.03 supply (resistance). Right now after we established demand at 405.06 last week the trend still is the upside and until a new supply (Resistance) is put in I would be looking for further upside. 

**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a6wxc9ns3oya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6621ba0880a3b8f06df3d78d3cc164b34414c9b3

We closed out yet another doji candle. This time though one could even argue this is a hanging man candle. Which would signal a short term top. However, we with only an 11 cent higher close than Friday its tough to say where this trend wants to go. 

The bulls did come down and test the daily 8ema and reconfirm it as support. I had plans to EOD Tuesday open some longer DTE puts on SPY… I was looking and hoping to be able to enter closer to 415-417… I was tempted to enter those today but knowing the unpredictability of SPY I decided to wait till tomorrow. 

With the VIX at 17 two days till CPI and SPY coming in on key 415.6 to 417 supplies/ resistance I like my risk to reward for puts… think about it not even looking at the numbers on CPI… is the risk to the downside or the upside? Currently the risk is to the downside. 

Fun fact we still have 4 daily gaps on Spy… 396.49-398.68, 401.6-401.76, 407.77-407.27 and 407.27- 408.64.

SPY Daily Levels  
 Supply- 415.6 -> 417  
 Demand- 405 -> 404.3  
 Support- 408.9 -> 407.9 -> 407 -> 405.2  
 Resistance- 414.9 -> 415.6 -> 416.8

Currently futures also finds itself in this 4074 to 4190 chop zone… this 4150 has been a real magnet in the markets…

With the demand being made on Friday we favor a push back to 4190 or a new supply (resistance) being established. 

**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1lr05iit3oya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6185727fe6da88fca9a7ae5e6b792abcd68fec78

Now when we look at the daily candle here on futures the bulls were able to avoid the true 4150 double top/ doji which woulda made me feel 100% confident in over night puts… but this makes it a little more indecisive. Futures daily still has about 45 minutes till close so I will watch for that close. 

Realistically with the daily 8ema being taken back and the 8ema holding as support here one would have to favor the bullish case on futures as well…

Honestly until after CPI on Wednesday we are likely to see some chop in this 4150 to 4190 range. 

Futures Daily Levels  
 Supply- 4190 -> 4198  
 Demand- 4074  
 Support- 4150 ->4110 -> 4095  
 Resistance- 4180 -> 4191 -> 4199

Now the VIX1D here is holding a nice downward trend. Now we are still in the early stages of learning VIX1D but im am watching closely still… one thing that I do note here is that we are now coming into that 8.49 support area which is where we double bottomed before. 

There is still a VIX1D gap at 14.55 to 14.71 too.

Now on the VIX here it actually for a little bit of time had me convinced of it not closing red… actually for most of the day the VIX held about a 50 cent range.

There has been a lot of disconnect in the VIX and markets but lately I have got to say its correlated pretty well… Favoritism would be to the downside on the VIX which is the upside on spy.

Today was a really rough trading day. That extremely tight range we had today was just trap after trap. In my trading I use technicals a lot for entries and exits and today was not a technical based day. I was able to grab a few wins here and there but still put in a red day. But overall not that bad of a day. Easily recoverable by EOW if not tomorrow.",2023-05-08 20:31:10,56,"Hi, thanks for all you do.

Curious- why do you think volatility indices should have to worry about gap filling? Isn't it just a simple calculation of movement in the 30 day (and now 0DTE) options chain? Why would it move in a chartable fashion? 

I too am watching VIX1D to figure out it's place.

And next step in my education is learning supply and demand zones - do you have any trusted learning materials to point me towards? 

Overall, I've been paper trading for WEEKS with insane green days. Then last Friday I decided to get in for real and the complete lack of volume then ans today killed me. Big red and popped my bubble on how confident I am with my strategy. I get outlier days happen, but I was hoping I'd have a bunch of wins racked up before having red days. Oh well. If I'd just picked calls Friday I'd have been set - but if you make trades outside your strategy that is when you are gambling. 

So I noticed you trade SPX. What's your strategy there? 1DTE I saw, what delta do you usually go for? Any issues with volume on fills? Do you do market fills or set a limit?

I typically trade a 5 or 10 SPY contracts at a Delta of .5 to .6 and go out however many days until theta is flat across the strikes. Typically 3 but sometimes as low as 1 or as high as 4.

I know SPX is tax advantaged but my understanding is that SPY has tighter spreads and market fills are very reliable. Obviously trade off is commission fees."

348,What I'm doing for PLTR earnings tonight,DD,"Today after-hours, Palantir is reporting latest earnings. Analysts are predicting earnings of $0.040 per share compared to earnings of $0.020 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. They're also expecting the company to report $505.8 million, an increase of 13.32% over the prior year quarter. Looking at the full year, analysts expect a profit of $0.207 per share. In the previous year there was a profit of $0.060 per share.

Over the last 2 years, PLTR has beaten EPS estimates 50% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 100% of the time. Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 4 upward revisions and 3 downward. Revenue estimates have seen 1 upward revision and 7 downward.

The data intelligence software company in mid February reported Q4 2022 results that beat estimates on both top- and bottom-line. The company also [forecasted](https://www.reuters.com/technology/palantir-expects-2023-be-first-profitable-year-sees-ai-driving-growth-2023-02-13/) 2023 to be its first year of profitability, sending its shares higher by more than 20%. I do expect the company to move towards sustainable operating profitability, especially with the recently announced [expansion](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pltr-stock-palantir-expands-microsoft-cloud-computing-pact-to-government-agencies/) of the company's cloud partnership with Microsoft (MSFT), which opens up a new revenue source.

However, PLTR shares have struggled since the company's strong Q4 report, having fallen about 20% up till their last close. In addition to this, the company in late February joined the string of technology firms that announced layoffs amid an economic slowdown. PLTR said it would reduce its workforce by around 2% in an effort to reduce costs. However, this isn't necessarily bad news.  Citi on Thursday said PLTR is likely to keep dealing with challenges posed by ""incremental commercial headwinds,"" despite ""resilient"" spending from the federal government.

**What to do for earnings?**

PLTR has moved on average 4% with earnings, but with a large standard deviation. I don't think there's sufficient news to predict whether it'll go up or down with any degree of confidence. However, due to low strike prices, options are really cheap. I'm picking up 5/12 8p at 58 bucks a pop. If the stock were to drop 4%, that wouldn't be a big enough move to deem the puts profitable. However, I'm treating this as a lotto play, hoping for a larger move downward; while not exactly 'expecting' it. Just playing with last week's profits from [AAPL's earning play](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/137wdc6/how_to_play_tonights_aapl_earnings_safely/) that I posted.",2023-05-08 17:34:09,74,"I did the opposite and bought calls after doing dd. 

Sorry for the loss. I am extremely happy though.

Hope you make it back in another bet."
349,Why I'm getting PYPL calls for earnings,DD,"Another major week of earnings around the world and across the market cap spectrum is on the way. Today PayPal (PYPL) kicks things off and will be reporting earnings from the most recent quarter this afternoon. With a solid EPS beat rate history and low valuation, I just had to make a post about it. [Last post was AAPL and it did fairly well](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/137wdc6/how_to_play_tonights_aapl_earnings_safely/). 

PYPL is a global, technology-driven payment platform with hundreds of millions of direct customer relationships in more than 200 countries. It empowers a streamlined digital and mobile payment experience in-browser, on mobile devices, and in-app. PayPal is also accepted at 75%+ of the largest 100 internet retailers. The California-based $85 billion market cap Transaction and Payment Processing Services industry company within the Financials sector trades at a high 12-month GAAP price-to-earnings ratio and does not pay a dividend, according to [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/).

Wall Street analysts expect PayPal will report earnings per share of $1.10 as opposed to earnings of $0.880 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. Analysts also expect sales to increase by 7.69% over the previous year's quarter to $6.98 billion. They expect an average profit of $4.89 per share for the current fiscal year, compared to $4.13 per share in the previous year. On average, analysts predict that the company will report annual sales of $29.38 billion.

**Factors at Play**

PayPal’s persistent efforts toward strengthening the product portfolio are likely to have aided the company in gaining traction among customers in the first quarter. The company’s upcoming results are likely to have benefited from Venmo’s product line strength, which is expected to have continued to aid customer engagement on PayPal’s platform. This is expected to have boosted growth in total active accounts in the quarter under review. Venmo’s strong monetization efforts are likely to have aided its adoption rate in the to-be-reported quarter.

Robust PayPal Checkout experiences are expected to have sustained the company’s momentum in the quarter under review. PayPal is expected to have gained from the growing proliferation of buy now pay later (BNPL) solution on the back of its strong offerings. Further, strengthening offerings for small businesses is likely to have boosted growth in the company’s payments volume in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.

**Key Metrics to Consider**

Total payment volume (TPV), active customer accounts, payment transactions per active account and the total number of payment transactions are considered to be the key metrics for analyzing PayPal’s business growth.

For the first quarter, the number of active customer accounts is estimated to be at 438 million, up 2.1% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for payment transactions per active user is pegged at 52 million, suggesting growth of 10.6% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. The consensus estimate for the total number of payment transactions is around 5.8 billion, indicating an improvement of 12.6% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure. The estimate floating around for TPV is pegged at $348 billion, suggesting growth of 7.8% on a year-over-year basis.

**But Q1 Results Won't just be a Game of Numbers**

PayPal was one of a host of fintech companies slashing headcounts earlier this year. Layoff announcements have largely rewarded shareholders, but the stock has not caught a major bid over the last several months. The business’s skew to lower- and middle-income consumers is a risk during this phase of the business cycle. Moreover, increasing competition from payment providers could high ARPU metrics this year – that will be a key metric to keep your eye on in the upcoming earnings report.

Amongst some [management changes](https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/02/10/paypal-ceo-to-step-down-good-news-for-investors/), it is key that the next phase of the business’s growth has a clear focus. Notably, the company's president and CEO Dan Schulman announced his retirement on Dec. 31, but said he will continue to serve on the board. About one month later, there were news on CFO Blake Jorgensen stepping down from his role after a leave of absence for health reasons. Also, PayPal's chief transformation officer and senior vice president of finance and analytics, Erica Gessert, joined the work marketplace Upwork as CFO in April. 

It’s expected that guidance will only be given one quarter at a time, but a guidance raise would certainly help the share price – and I think we could get that based on decent numbers from other firms in the industry.

**Competitive Risks**

PYPL has exposure to how the macro consumer picture evolves. Should a deeper recession take place, then the firm will struggle. Also, I think too much focus on slashing expenses could be a risk to market share - if that mindset cuts into high-ROI initiatives, then its competitors could pounce. I also have apprehension regarding how the new CEO will lead as smaller transaction players grow. What's more, new regulations in the industry could hurt a larger player like PayPal and potentially favor smaller companies with less dominance.

**Peer Comparison**

Relative to its competitors, PYPL is priced with a mid-range valuation. I took a look at Fiserv (FISV), Adyen (OTCPK:ADYEY), Block (SQ), Fidelity National Financial Information Services (FIS), and Global Payments (GPN). Forward operating P/Es range from 9.4 on the low end (FIS) to more than 70 with ADYEY. PYPL's 1.09 PEG is attractive compared to its peers - only GPN has a lower ratio using forward estimates.

But PYPL sports better revenue growth than GPN in the out year, with a better net income margin. PYPL is also the leader in the space with its $85 billion market cap, and market share should be protected should the management team execute well on PayPal's next stage of growth.

**Catalysts**

I'll be looking for what the new CEO has to say on upcoming product developments as it introduces upgrades to Venmo and other digital wallet services. If those come to fruition, then there's a reasonable chance that 2023 EPS guidance of $4.87 could be raised.

What could help support the stock this year is the firm's stock buyback plan. With about $5 billion of net free cash flow in FY23, there's ample room for at least $3 billion.

Another upside catalyst is activism from [Elliott Management](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/30/activist-elliott-snaps-up-an-interest-in-paypal-this-is-what-could-be-next-for-the-payments-giant.html). That pressure could result in further cost-cutting initiatives. In addition to buybacks, a dividend announcement can't be ruled out - I assert that would be viewed positively by the market since the company has plenty of FCF to reward shareholders while still funding growth projects. A new, streamlined PayPal may be needed in this competitive landscape.

**Valuation**

On valuation, analysts at [BofA](https://business.bofa.com/en-us/content/global-research-about.html) see earnings rebounding sharply in 2023 after declines last year. Per-share profits are seen as continuing to rise at a double-digit pace through 2025. The [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/) consensus outlook is about on par with what BofA projects. No dividends are expected to be paid on the stock, but PYPL is solidly free cash flow positive.

https://i.imgur.com/EwPJGOY.png

Using out-year estimates, the earnings multiples are attractive on the stock considering the high growth outlook. What’s more, the EV/EBITDA ratio is about in line with the market. Overall, if we assign just a 20x forward P/E (a sharp discount to its 37.7 5-year average), then the stock should be near $98. Lastly, the forward PEG ratio is very low at 1.09 compared to the 5-year mean of 1.97.

**Looking at the Options Chain**

Digging into the upcoming earnings report, data from Option Research & Technology Services ([ORATS](https://orats.com/)) show a consensus EPS forecast of $1.10 which would be a strong 25% climb from $0.88 of per-share profits earned in the same period a year ago. ORATS reports that there have been six analyst upgrades of EPS estimates since the February quarterly report. With a strong beat rate history, topping estimates in 11 of the 12 last instances, an earnings beat is likely. But shares have a mixed performance history following earnings dates.

This time around, the options market has priced in a 6.6% earnings-related stock price swing. That is the cheapest straddle dating back to July of 2021. With a lower VIX today, it makes sense. Also, notice small moves in the stock in the previous pair of earnings reactions. Overall, I see the options as fairly priced given these dynamics. So with a strong EPS beat rate history, and with cheaper options, are calls in order?

**The Technicals**

With an attractive valuation and fairly valued options before Monday evening’s earnings release, the chart is less sanguine. Notice in the graph below that shares are consolidating in a descending triangle pattern. The presumption is that price action will resolve in the trend of larger degree – which is lower in this instance. A breakdown under $65 would imply a measured move price objective at an absurdly low level based on the top of the pattern being near $120, so we need a more realistic support bogey.

There is longer-term support in the low to mid-$40s that likely attracts buyers. But a move above $90 would help support the case for a bullish breakout from the pattern. Also, the $81 level represents the flat 200-day moving average (the 40-week moving average is essentially the same thing), so rising above that on a weekly closing basis would be bullish

**What to do for Earnings?**

Paypal moves on average about 7.6 ± 5.9% with earnings. Last earnings, it rose about 6%. Could we see another rise like it? If so, a PYPL call spread looks good, grabbing the 5/12 80c for $140 and selling the 85c for $53 (at the time of writing this). This means you can get the spread for $87, this could offer 5.7x gains. Ideally we want the stock to go up to $81-85, an increase of 5.8 to 11.4%. Keep in mind, with earnings you can never predict things with certainty. This post is not financial or investment advice, consider it as just me offering some education based on what analysts tend to look for in a company when it's time to make a last minute earnings prediction. In fact, just because I'm posting it, Paypal might crash. Just as an F you.",2023-05-08 18:10:55,59,I scrolled and scrolled through the gibberish.  Only to post I 10xed pypl puts after earnings.

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
* **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.
* **Expiration:** 2023-05-12.
* **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

352,Market Recap - 5/8/23 - No one wants your money,Discussion,"**The Fed**

Some good news on the disinflation front today:

NY Fed consumer survey showed April one-year ahead expected inflation at 4.4% vs. March's 4.7%; expected household spending falls to 5.2%, the weakest since September 2021.

Wage growth falling steadily in April as well.

Fed's Goolsbee: ""Getting 'vibes' that a credit squeeze is beginning."" Whatever that means...

All eyes were on the SLOOLS report, which turned out to be absolutely underwhelming.

Banks are still tightening lending standards for commercial and industrial loans while raising funding spreads as a cushion against default risk. However, the net percentage change was only slightly higher compared to Q4 last year.

https://preview.redd.it/x9epd2n83pya1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3596d419e15727c07457e249212c7fa4e460f82a

But at the same time, reported demand for new loans is also down for several reasons including increasing difficulty to secure funding from lenders, risen cost of funding which makes it less attractive for borrowers, low confidence in the economy which has resulted in a lack of interest in expanding or making large asset purchases.

There has been a lot of attention on commercial real estate (CRE) loans. As expected, banks are tightening their lending standards even further on CRE loans. But demand of these loans is also lower, leading to the worst reported contraction in CRE loan demand in recent years. But again, the change compared to Q4 last year was small.

So, turns out no one wants money. Banks don't want deposits because they're a liability (otherwise, they would have raised their deposit interest a long time ago). Businesses don't want loans because the interest rate is too high, and banks don't want business because there is just too much risk. I guess we will all just continue to grind down our savings until the Fed cuts?

**The Economy**The wholesale inventories/sales ratio climbed higher to 1.40 in March, indicating a further slowdown in production might follow. It's important to note that this data reflects the situation in March and represents a lagging indicator.

Temporary help services payrolls, which are often regarded as a leading indicator for overall employment, have experienced a year-over-year decline of 3.8% through April. This significant decrease suggests potential challenges in the job market ahead.

So in the image above, I show 2023 q1 compared to 2022 q4. 

In 2022 Q4 we had an operating loss and only went positive on GAAP EPS because of an ""Other Income"" line item which turned out to be a remeasurement of the PLTR Japan joint venture acquisition. When they said earnings were positive here, it was somewhat misleading because the operations netted a loss.

Now in 2023 Q1, we have positive operating income. This is a good thing!

&#x200B;

We also see a trend from quarter to quarter where stock-based compensation is going down This is not a cash expense, but it does show up as an expense following generally accepted accounting principles. It's usually sprinkled through many different areas of expenses but does not have its own line item in the income statement.

This virus is continuing to wreak havoc on a global scale.

The Lancet just accused India of running a cover up of 4.5 million dead in 2020 and 2021. But the virus hasn't stopped, and those numbers are likely 7 million+ including 2022.

>Modi's government have shown themselves to be wholly untrustworthy on COVID-19 health data. Official government figures place deaths at more than 530 000, while WHO excess death estimates for 2020 and 2021 are near 4·7 million. The fact that the Indian Government attempted to delay the publication of such figures while also censoring criticism during the pandemic seriously undermines its integrity.

World wide excess deaths are through the roof. Note that this uses something akin to a 5 year rolling average. As year 5 approaches, the excess deaths become normal. No one asks if it's the upper bound. 😯

369,From Love to Loss: My Journey with WallStreetBets,Meme,"**Part One: Falling in Love with BedBath&Beyond and GameStop**

I still remember the first time I stumbled upon the world of stock trading. It was a boring afternoon, and I was scrolling through Reddit when I came across a post about a short squeeze that was happening in GameStop. Being a curious person, I delved deeper and read about how a group of retail investors was taking on Wall Street and winning. I was hooked.

Over the next few weeks, I spent all my free time reading about stocks, options, and trading strategies. I started by investing small amounts of money in stocks I had researched and believed in, and soon enough, I was spending hours each day analyzing market trends and making informed investment decisions.

But it wasn't until I discovered Bed Bath & Beyond that I truly fell in love with the stock market. The company was struggling, with its stock price plummeting and analysts giving it a bleak outlook. But something about it caught my attention. I began researching the company and its financials, and to my surprise, I found that the company had a significant amount of cash and was taking steps to turn things around.

I began buying BedBath&Beyond shares at a low price and holding them, hoping that the company's turnaround efforts would pay off and the stock price would rise. And as I watched the stock price slowly climb, I felt a rush of excitement and adrenaline. I was hooked on the thrill of investing.

But it wasn't just the thrill of investing that had me hooked - it was also the community of traders and investors that I had found online. I joined Discord groups and Reddit threads where I could discuss stocks, strategies, and market trends with like-minded individuals. We shared our successes and failures, and I felt like I had found a group of people who understood me.


And then, GameStop happened. It was like a dream come true for me - a group of retail investors taking on Wall Street and winning. I followed every update on the short squeeze, watching as the stock price skyrocketed. And when I saw that the price had reached $400, I couldn't contain my excitement. I had never felt so alive.

I had become obsessed with the stock market, with GameStop and BedBath&Beyond being my greatest passions. I yearned for the short squeeze, the moment when I could make a killing and prove to everyone that retail investors could win against Wall Street. And even as doubts began to surface and the short squeeze ended, I couldn't let go of my love for the stock market and the thrill of investing. It was a love affair that would last a lifetime.

-

**Part Two: Risks and Uncertainty**

Despite the risks and uncertainty, I couldn't resist the allure of GameStop and BedBath&Beyond. My love for the stocks and my infatuation with Ryan Cohen only grew stronger with each passing day. I spent all my free time researching the companies, reading forums, and analyzing market trends to make informed decisions about my investments.

As the price of the stocks began to rise, my excitement and anticipation grew. I knew that a short squeeze could be on the horizon, and the potential profits were too enticing to ignore. I spent hours imagining what it would feel like to be part of such a historic event, to see the short sellers scramble to cover their positions, and to watch the stock price skyrocket.

The closer we got to the potential short squeeze, the more I obsessed over GameStop and BedBath&Beyond. I would refresh my trading app constantly, watching the stock prices fluctuate. I checked forums and social media sites, eagerly devouring any news or rumors that could impact the stocks. I even had dreams about the short squeeze, waking up each morning feeling both exhilarated and anxious.

Then, one day, the moment I had been waiting for arrived. The short squeeze was in full swing, and GameStop and BedBath&Beyond were soaring to new heights. My portfolio was exploding with gains, and I was elated. It felt like my dreams were coming true, and nothing could bring me down.

But as the days passed, the short squeeze began to lose steam. The stock prices started to fall, and the profits I had made began to dwindle. My once-rosy outlook was now replaced with worry and uncertainty. Had I made a mistake by investing so heavily in these stocks? Was the short squeeze just a fluke, or could there be another one on the horizon?

Despite my doubts, I couldn't let go of my love for GameStop and BedBath&Beyond. I continued to hold on to my shares, hoping that they would rebound. I followed the news and market trends religiously, searching for any signs of another short squeeze. I even convinced some of my friends and family to invest in the stocks, eager to share my passion and potential profits with them.

Days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. The stocks remained volatile, and the short squeeze I had yearned for never materialized again. My portfolio was up and down, but never quite reaching the heights it had during the initial squeeze.

As time passed, my love for GameStop and BedBath&Beyond began to wane. The stocks had consumed so much of my time and energy, and the uncertainty had become too much to bear. I realized that my love for Ryan Cohen and the stocks had been nothing more than a fleeting infatuation, and that it was time to move on.

But even as I sold my shares and moved on to other investments, I knew that I would always look back on my time with GameStop and BedBath&Beyond with a mix of fondness and regret. They had been my first love in the stock market, and even though the short squeeze had not gone as planned, I knew that the lessons I learned from the experience would stay with me forever.

-

**Part Three: Days Gone Past**

As the days went by, I found myself feeling more and more lost. I had put so much of myself into investing in GameStop and BedBath&Beyond that I didn't know who I was without them. I felt like I had lost my sense of purpose, and I didn't know how to move forward.

It wasn't until I met someone new that I began to feel like myself again. His name was Alex, and he was a fellow investor who shared my passion for the stock market. We met through a mutual friend and hit it off immediately.

At first, I was hesitant to let Alex into my life. After what had happened with Ryan and BedBath&Beyond, I wasn't sure if I could trust anyone else in the world of investing. But there was something about Alex that drew me in. He was kind, smart, and had a great sense of humor. Plus, he was just as passionate about investing as I was.

We started spending more and more time together, discussing stocks and market trends. It felt like we could talk for hours on end, and I loved every moment of it. He made me laugh, and he reminded me why I fell in love with investing in the first place.

As we got to know each other better, I began to open up to him about my experiences with Ryan and BedBath&Beyond. I was hesitant at first, but Alex listened to me with an open mind and a kind heart. He didn't judge me for my mistakes or my losses. Instead, he encouraged me to keep going and to never give up on my passion.

With Alex by my side, I started to invest again. It was scary at first, but he helped me to feel confident and secure in my decisions. We worked together to research new stocks and to analyze market trends. And though we didn't always agree on everything, we respected each other's opinions and worked together to make informed decisions.

Over time, my investments began to grow again. It wasn't as fast as it had been with GameStop and BedBath&Beyond, but it was steady and consistent. And with Alex by my side, I felt more fulfilled than ever before. I knew that I had found someone who loved me for who I was, flaws and all, and who shared my passion for investing.

Looking back on my experiences with GameStop, BedBath&Beyond, and Ryan Cohen, I realize that they were all a part of my journey. They taught me valuable lessons about love, investing, and taking risks. And though there were times when I felt lost and alone, I know now that I was never truly alone. There were always people by my side, supporting me and cheering me on.

As I continue on my journey, I know that there will be more ups and downs. The stock market is unpredictable, and love can be even more so. But with Alex by my side, I feel more ready than ever to face whatever comes my way. And I know that, no matter what happens, I will always be passionate about investing, and I will always be willing to take risks for the things that I love.

-

**Part Four: Finale**

Unfortunate as it may be, Alex left me. I couldn't help but feel a deep sense of shame and regret. My family had cast me away, cutting off all communication and support, and I couldn't blame them. I had repeatedly gone all-in on risky stocks, taking out loans from family members and friends, convinced that my luck would turn and I would be able to pay them back tenfold.

But that never happened. Instead, I watched as my investments crashed and burned, taking my dreams and finances down with them. I was left with nothing but debts and regrets, wondering how I could have been so foolish and reckless.

For months, I wallowed in self-pity, too ashamed to face my family and friends, too afraid to admit how badly I had messed up. But as time passed, I began to realize that my mistakes didn't define me. I could learn from them, grow from them, and use them to become a better, more responsible person.

So I began to pick myself up, piece by piece, slowly but surely. I took on multiple jobs, worked long hours, and lived frugally to pay off my debts. I made amends with my family, apologizing for my mistakes and promising to do better.

And though I may have lost my savings and my family's trust, I didn't lose my spirit. I still felt the thrill of the stock market, the excitement of the short squeeze, the hope of a big win. I knew I couldn't let my failures define me, couldn't let my family's disappointment crush my spirit.

So I started again, small and steady. I began to invest a portion of my earnings in more stable, less risky stocks, slowly rebuilding my portfolio and my confidence. I followed the markets closely, learning from my mistakes, making more informed decisions.

And though it would be a long and difficult journey, I knew that one day I would return to WallStreetBets, not as a lost and foolish gambler, but as a seasoned and savvy investor. One day, I would make my family proud, not just with my financial success, but with my resilience and determination.

Until then, I would keep learning, growing, and moving forward, one step at a time. And who knows, maybe one day, I'll even get that short squeeze I've been yearning for all these years.",2023-05-08 20:38:25,10,This fuking guy... ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8883)just tell me puts or calls on spy

They also gave us next quarter guidance telling us that with FX tailwinds that revenue will be up about 7.5 to 8% YOY and EPS would be about .82 versus (.29) or .16 if you add back in the negative impact of their strategic investment portfolio. So this looks good as well
